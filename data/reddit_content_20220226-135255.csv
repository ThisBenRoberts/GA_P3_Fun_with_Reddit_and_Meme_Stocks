2,Is $LFLY / Leafly way overvalued and a BIG short?,"$LFLY aka [Leafly](https://www.leafly.com/) is supposedly an online 'marketplace' where one can go learn and place orders for marijuana.  When the company went public, it went public on an Enterprise Value of $[388M](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1785592/000121390021054183/ea149176ex10-1_merida1.htm) with 2021 revenue of $43M and obviously **negative earnings**, like most 'growth' stocks.  It's main competitors in the market right now are Dutchie and Weedmaps, with Weedmaps offering the most similar service to Leafly.  Leafly itself has this [comparison chart](https://imgur.com/a/ZI1xv1U) vs competitors, but in my opinion this chart is very misleading at best.  The other competitors listed don't matter except for maybe iHeartJane, but I'll get to that later since iHeartJane and Leafly are actually jointly working together.

**Weed Industry**

Anyone who follows weed stocks know that it has been battered down in the past year after reaching highs around Feb of 2021.  The most well known ETF is $MSOS, which you can use as a tracker for how weed stocks are performing.  With that said, because weed is still illegal federally, most weed stocks are not listed on the major exchanges.  Those that are not 'weed touching' aka offer ancillary products and services, like $LFLY and $MAPS and $AGFY are however allowed to be listed on exchanges like NASDAQ. Some believe that if weed is legalized, there will be a pop in prices just from the uplisting of tickers as more people can now buy the stock itself.  $LFLY won't get the benefit of this uplisting, just the overall benefit of weed legalization.

Now weed legalization itself is a headache on a federal level.  I won't get into who's right and who's wrong, but the odds of it happening are VERY slim, unless the Democrats are so desperate during midterms that they'll cave in.  From a high level, this is what's going on.  The House has been willing to [pass](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/us-house-passes-safe-banking-act-part-defense-bill)  the SAFE Banking Act, and I believe numerous times.  The SAFE Banking Act basically eliminates regulatory risk of banks dealing directly with weed companies (that's why today when you buy weed, it's still 'Cash Only').  This would help out the industry quite a bit, and you can imagine how helpful it would be for online ordering.

The hold up is in the Senate.  The Republicans seem to be okay with passing the SAFE Banking Act and as of today, want to posture themselves as somewhat pro-weed, even though historically it's been the Democrats that have been pushing weed legalization.  That's why you have representatives like Nancy Mace trying to introduce weed legalization [acts.](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/south-carolina-republican-introduces-bill-decriminalize-marijuana-federal-level-n1283913) In other words, Reps are trying to position themselves to get some credit for legalizing weed.  The Democrats don't want to legalize weed, because 1) They don't want Republicans to take credit and 2) They want to also pass a bunch of social equity / social justice measures alongside the legalization of marijuana.  The Reps obviously don't agree with the social equity measures (such as letting every charged weed dealer go free), and so, in a nutshell, weed legalization probably won't occur any time soon due to politics and maybe not even in our lifetime.  All 50 states could have legalized weed and on a Federal level, it still may not be legalized due to 'politics'.

With that said, yes, if weed was legalized tomorrow, it would boost all Weed stocks INCLUDING $LFLY.  The TAM of weed is huge and so from an industry standpoint, there are many tailwinds that could help out the stocks.  As for when those tailwinds will actually occur - that's highly speculative.

**What Does Leafly Do**

As I mentioned before, Leafly views itself as an online marketplace for weed.  Basically stores pay Leafly money to be listed on their website, and the hope is Leafly drives customers to buy weed from the store.  The more customers that visit the website, the more important it is for a store to be listed on the website.  Even though that's it's current business, Leafly's mission statement is in contrast from that.  Leafly's mission statement is to  ['help people discover cannabis'](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1785592/000121390021041012/ea145444-425_meridamerger1.htm),  and it's goal is to be a repository of weed strains and the top place for one to [educate](https://twitter.com/Leafly/status/1282706665175834626) yourself on weed.  

Now that sounds great on paper, to be basically the Wiki of weed, but when you take a step back, how does that even make money?  There are millions of blogs out there on every single product, yet, how many of those are million or billion dollar companies.  Wiki itself survives on donations, not from monetization.   Don't get me wrong.  Leafly is probably the best source on the internet to learn about weed strains and Leafly itself publishes frequent industry [reports](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220223005383/en/Legal-Cannabis-Industry-is-the-Most-Prolific-Job-Creator-in-America---Supporting-More-Than-428000-Jobs) that are widely cited.  They are a trusted brand, but how does all that equate to $$$?  If you need a business consultant, you go to McKinsey and Co, not Leafly.   If you want to learn about weed, well you could always just Google.

You can see that monetization is an issue already. If you look at Google Search [Trends](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%201-m&amp;geo=US&amp;q=leafly,weedmaps), Leafly and Weedmaps are basically neck and neck, yet Leafly only managed to make \~40M last year while Weedmaps makes \~50M a QUARTER.  Similarweb also paints a similar [story](https://www.similarweb.com/website/leafly.com/vs/weedmaps.com/#overview).  Traffic is neck and neck and in some cases Leafly comes out ahead.  **Yet, where's the money**?  Leafly seems to be more interested in creating fancy blogs than actually trying to build a business that offers returns for investors.  Leafly's ONLY competitive advantage is the content on its website and that's it - and it even admits to this.  If weed were to be legalized, it's entirely possible for many other advertising channels to open up (Google and Facebook for example) that may provide even better ROI for companies.   With that said, there'd still be a lot of regulatory stuff these new entrants would have to work through, and additionally, it's not like Facebook and Google really advertise tobacco and alcohol.  But the risk is there in which a dispensary finds that it makes more sense to advertise elsewhere, decreasing margins for Leafly.

Now that we understand that the '[moat](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1785592/000121390021041012/ea145444-425_meridamerger1.htm)' for Leafly is basically it's glorified Pokedex, let's review that competitive landscape [slide](https://imgur.com/a/ZI1xv1U) again.

* **Consumer Marketplace**:  I agree with their assessment.  Leafly and Maps are currently at the tops when it comes to the weed marketplace scene.  With that said, upon legalization, you could imagine, Grubhub, Doordash, Uber Eats, Google, Amazon, etc.. all potentially joining the market.
* **Size Of Audience**: I also agree with their assessment.  Leafly does command the most traffic out of it's competitors right now.  But once again, upon legalization, Google, Instagram, Yelp, etc.. may exceed Leafly traffic and be better advertising channels.
* **Consumer Matching Technology**:
* **Content and Educational Library**: Agree here, this is their moat.  This is probably the only thing that will still hold true after legalization
* **Reviews**: Agree here, but Google and Yelp and many other places have 'reviews too.
* **Market Penetration**: This is misleading but yes, out of the other companies listed on the slide, this is true.  But once again, Google, Uber Eats, Grubhub, etc.. are all waiting on the sideline.
* **Ecomm-Enablement**:  This I HIGHLY disagree with, and will expand upon next.   I'd put Leafly at 1/4 the pie if anything, not 3/4 like they suggest.
* **Monetization**: HA - this is the company that basically makes the least money out of Weedmaps and Dutchie.  This one is pure false.  We've already talked about monetization issues.  
* **Data Insights**: I'm very surprised that Leafly thinks it's own data is worse than Weedmaps.  Since this is an investor presentation, the reality may be even worse.  This basically takes away some credibility as being the 'source of info' for weed.

**Ecomm-Enablement - The Big Red Flag (outside of inability to monetize)**

So about this stuff.  Ecomm Enablement is basically the ability for stores to sell their product online and through Leafly's website.  Yoko Miyashita, the CEO of Leafly, already is throwing shade at this concept.  Here's what she said:

&gt;We view the competitive landscape as a funnel - **at the top: there are consumer marketplaces and customer acquisition channels; at the middle, online ordering enablement; at the bottom, back-end tech and feature/service providers, like POS and loyalty services**. Moving Left to right on the slide - At the top, there are 2 leading consumer marketplaces but ours is differentiated by our content, that allows us to build demand in a market before legalization, and match consumers to the right products. Our strains database and user generated content can’t be created quickly. It has to be purchased or built over time. And that, in and of itself, is a moat for our business. We are geographically dispersed and focused at the top of the funnel, because **we believe remaining asset-light focused at the top of the funnel allows us to scale at a lower cost** and higher velocity across more markets. Going across the chart and deeper down the funnel. There are order enablement providers, but we have embed menus, too and offer a powerful top of funnel demand generation engine, that isn’t part of competitor offerings. 

Leafly keeps on 'thinking' it's an online marketplace for weed, when in actuality, it's a glorified pokedex.  The reason why Leafly is not a viable online marketplace, is because it places ZERO emphasis on the market place infrastructure itself (which it itself thinks is at the bottom of the totem pole in terms of importance).  In order to have a viable market place, businesses, need to be able to list their products in a seamless manner on the market place and customers need to be able to seamlessly buy said products.  If there are hiccups in this process, it drives customers away and businesses lose money.  There are may ways this process can breakdown.  For example, products that are supposedly available but then not available upon checkout.  Or, customers receiving the wrong product etc...  each of these could reduce the conversion rate of customers and reduce the number of repeat customers.

Everyone understands that to increase the conversion rate for customers, you won't their shopping experience to be as easy and smooth as possible, yet Leafly doesn't understand this AT ALL, given that it wants to remain a Pokedex - as given by the CEO's own statements.

Yet Leafly's competitors understand this.  This is where my discussion of iHeartJane comes in.  You can see on the completive chart that Dutchie and iHeartJane are ranked the highest when it comes to Ecomm-Enablement and that is true.  Both Dutchie and iHeartJane offer POS systems (which is the system that allows you to accept payments from customers and keep track of sales and inventory).  In fact, POSs are so important that Dutchie went out and [acquired](https://business.dutchie.com/post/dutchie-acquires-leaflogix-greenbits-and-closes-200m-series-c) the two top POS systems in Greenbits and Leaflogix in March of last year.  Weedmaps, instead of buying POSs has its own internal developed POS system that integrates with its marketplace.  

What does Leafly have?  As far as I know, Leafly has nothing, it's an online pokedex. Well actually, Leafly got so scared at this industry development that it did the only thing it could with it's limited funds and that was to [partner](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210204005356/en/Leafly-and-Jane-Announce-Strategic-Partnership-to-Build-Enriched-Cannabis-Shopping-Experiences) with iHeartJane, which also is a top POS system.  **But partnership is NOT ownership**.

Why is ownership important?  Well like I said, seamless integration with the online marketplace is important.  The problems I mentioned before DO happen in the weed industry.  That is, what a customer sees as 'available' online may not be the actual inventory a store has.  A store may have just sold it's last pre-roll to a walk-in customer, yet another customer ordering online may still be able to buy it, only to later find out that it's sold out already.  That provides a VERY POOR experience to the customer.  As far as I know, Leafly does not have it's own in house POS system, and in fact, the CEO herself throws shade at this concept.  She touts the pokedex being asset light, which is true, and the other 'stuff' as beneath Leafly.   But you know what else is asset light? SaaS, which is what a POS is.  

Not only that, when it comes to SaaS, that's recurring revenue that businesses love.  SaaS also means that it has it's own ecosystem and everyone knows, once you are on an ecosystem, even if you hate it, it's a pain to switch ecosystems. Leafly has no sticking power with businesses, only consumers.  It hopes that it's pokedex will bring enough customers that businesses will be FORCED to list on their website and pay Lealfy money.  Other than traffic, Leafly has no other pull with businesses.  And we all know that traffic can fall tomorrow if Facebook or Google are better marketing channels.  Also what if  Dutchie decides to buy iHeartJane tomorrow?  Well Leafly then becomes purely a very overvalued blog.

Monetization, is not in Leafly's genes and that's why the business is doomed.

In fact, I can't find the article now, but will tried to find it, Leafly has said it's goal is NOT to aggressively acquire customers (note customers are the businesses that list on the website) when Weedmaps and Dutchie are currently doing that exact thing.  I can see Leafly being left in the dust when things settle as most dispensaries end up signing with Maps and Dutchie for their POS, and iHeartJane eventually does it's own thing or gets bought out.

Yoko herself has a legal background (which is great for navigating the regulations of each state), but that doesn't exactly create further confidence for this company to make money for investors.  I don't have much confidence in her running the business.

**Valuation**

You can check valuation yourself but just look at Weedmap's revenue, POSITIVE EBITDA, and EV vs Leafly's and you can see Leafly is definitely overvalued.

4,Post Russian conflict theory: large investments in alternative energy in Europe &amp; potential opportunities in the stock market.,"The European Union supplies nearly 40 percent of its gas and **more than a quarter of its oil from Russia**. That energy heats Europe's homes, powers its factories and fuels its vehicles and is a key resource for the continent.   
I believe that the current conflict with Russia will lead to heavy investments in alternative sources of energy. A pressure to do this already exists from climate change but the conflict with Russia will bring it to the next level. European leaders will be determined to lower their extreme energy dependence on russia and should start seriously investing in other sources of energy. 

I think this is not a novel idea and seems quite an obvious strategic decision. 

I am looking for european stocks or index funds focused on renewable energy or energy in general that will benefit from my theory. It is also good to note that we just experienced a small crash in the market so it's the perfect time to scoop up shares for cheap. Once all of this war settles down, European leaders will announce plans for funding in energy and these stocks will boom.

10,Semiconductors in the next 6-12 months,"Just wondering what people's thoughts are on semis this year. When I look at P/E - and I understand this is a very simple comparison, but still a useful metric. I also understand that companies play to different markets, but this is more of a general semi question/debate.

P/E and Next 5-year growth rate 

NVidia:  62.83     30.2%  
AMD:     47.03     29.9%  
TSM:      27.13     20.3%  
QCOM:  19.59     14.7%  (maybe this doesn't belong in this group?)

So, where does the value lie on this group? More importantly, who in the group is likely to be punished this year during rate hikes? I hold AMD still, but sold NVidia near the end of last year (took some profit to balance some losses). TSM looks like a great  pick... if only it wasn't in China (too risky for me).

12,Buy and Hold statistically superior to Trading,"The math is simple. Buy and hold strategies are statistically superior to trading strategies as proven by the laws of probabilities. This is how I view it but am open to debate and aspects I am missing. Keep in mind I am intentionally keeping this simple and ignoring lots of nuance. Also, I only invest in index funds that will never go bankrupt, so keep that in mind. Regardless of the ETF vs individual stock argument, I think this math is sound and important to consider.

If you are a day trader, every decision you make has only a 25% chance of success. Some may misinterpret the grid below and say chance of success is 50/50, but that isn’t correct since your probability is limited to one decision and one outcome at a time. Overall chance of success is 50%, but each decision you make only has a 25% chance. It’s kind of like the Monty Hall problem.

Day Traders 
        Market up | Market down 
Buy     1/4 *                    1/4 
Sell      1/4                      1/4* 
* successful outcome 


Compare this to a buy and hold strategy where your decisions always have a 50/50 chance of success. You never sell, therefore you never open yourself up to the sell probabilities. 

          Market up | Market down 
Buy        1/2 *                  1/2

29,Why not just buy mega cap indexes?,"I have been more successful than not in the stock market regarding individual stocks. I also know it took hours of research, some luck, and having the means to throw $4k here and $11k there to make some nice gains over the course of a few months. 

With that all said, I wanted to know what would be so bad with just taking all of my stocks, selling them today (yes, even Apple, Microsoft and Tesla) and just investing in say 3 to 4 mega cap indexes? Mega cap indexes on average outperform your S&amp;P 500 trackers/the well known etfs. 

**Vanguard Mega Cap (VMCTX) 5 year rate of return: 88.55%** 

Vanguard 500 (VOO) 5 year rate of return: 83.75% 

**iShares S&amp;P 100 ETF (OEF) 5 year rate of return: 89.45%** 

iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) 5 year rate of return: 83.19% 

Tell me I am overlooking something. Otherwise, I do not see any reason to continue holding VOO when I can make more in VMCTX. 

Just to be clear, had I from day one close to 8 years ago just bought VMCTX and OEF I would be very close to where I am right now (I average 20% annual returns before taxes). 

Current positions: Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Old Dominion Freight, Cloudflare, Wayfair. Also invest heavily in VOO and VTI.",stocks,1645885995

# **With the stock market’s snapback, the focus shifts to Powell testimony and jobs report - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/25/with-the-stock-markets-snapback-the-focus-shifts-to-powell-testimony-and-jobs-report.html)**
*****
&gt; Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell testifies before Congress in the week ahead, and markets will hang on what he says regarding how the Russia-Ukraine conflict could affect Fed policy.
*****
&gt; Powell will deliver his testimony on the economy to the House Committee on Financial Services on Wednesday morning, and then again to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. The important February employment report is to be released on Friday.
*****
&gt; “Powell speaking is going to be important. Everybody’s trying to get a gauge of how he’s seeing what the Fed’s policy reaction might be in light of recent events,” said Jim Caron, head of macro strategies for global fixed income at Morgan Stanley Investment Management.
*****
&gt; Investors also are keeping a careful eye on the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and its related impact on markets, with Russia being a major commodity exporter. Oil initially shot higher in the past week, with Brent crude surging to $105 per barrel before settling back down to about $98 on Friday.
*****
&gt; “I think Powell’s going to have to still be pretty hawkish, even though there’s still concerns about what oil prices are going to do to demand. The surge in oil prices is coming at the worst possible time,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.” It’s stoking a well-kindled fire of inflation.”
*****
&gt; # Market reversal
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 posted a weekly gain after some wild swings. Stocks fell sharply Thursday on news of the invasion, but later bounced. The index extended that rebound into Friday, rising more than 2%. Bond yields, initially lower in a flight-to-safety trade, reversed course and were higher Friday.
*****
&gt; “Treasurys are supposed to be the flight-to-safety asset, and you didn’t make money in Treasurys when you had a geopolitical event,” Caron said. Yields move inversely to prices, and the 10-year yield was back near 2% on Friday. “There’s no place to run, no place to hide. I think a lot of that has to do with peoples’ expectations for interest rate policy and also inflation.”
*****
&gt; Jeff Kleintop, Charles Schwab chief global investment strategist, said the stock market was relieved with the clarity on sanctions against Russia. President Joe Biden announced on Thursday a new round of sanctions after the invasion.
*****
&gt; “The fact they specifically excluded energy and agriculture [in the new sanctions] means the spillover effects to the global economy are very limited,” Kleintop said. “It doesn’t change some of the trends that were in place prior to the invasion, which of course is the tightening of financial conditions and concerns about inflation.”
*****
&gt; Goldman Sachs economists said the impact on global gross domestic product will likely be small, since both Russia and Ukraine together account for just about 2% of global market-based GDP.
*****
&gt; “In contrast, spillovers via commodity markets (Russia produces 11% and 17% of global oil and gas) and financial conditions could be somewhat larger,” the economists noted.
*****
&gt; # Fed rate hikes
&gt; Schwab’s Kleintop said he expects the stock market to remain volatile into the Fed’s first rate hike, expected at its March meeting.
*****
&gt; “We have been in a downtrend. Markets are concerned about valuations,” he said. As focus shifts away from Ukraine, “I think we’ll settle back to that more difficult, more volatile environment, but the concerns that this is a major disruptive break that completely changes the backdrop is probably not turning out to be the case.”
*****
&gt; Caron said investors are looking for some clarity on whether the Ukraine situation could cause the Fed to slow down interest rate hikes in 2022.
*****
&gt; A big question remains as to whether the Fed might raise rates by 50 basis points on March 16 to kick off its first round of rate increases since 2018. A basis point is equal to 0.01%.
*****
&gt; “I do think that the situation in the Ukraine makes it much less likely they will raise by 50 basis points this time around,” said PNC chief economist Gus Faucher, noting that the Fed will keep on a steady course and weigh the circumstances as it moves to hike.
*****
&gt; However, traders will also look for clues on how the central bank could go about reducing its nearly $9 trillion balance sheet.
*****
&gt; Caron said many investors expect the Fed to begin reducing its holdings of Treasury and mortgage securities by June or July.
*****
&gt; “It’s really about liquidity in the market. What we’re really trying to assess is whether this Russia-Ukraine creates a systemic risk,” he said. Downsizing the balance sheet is about draining liquidity from the financial system.
*****
&gt; Caron added the stock market was getting some relief from the belief the Fed will not move as quickly as some expect because of the Ukraine conflict. “People believe rates are going to go higher, but not uncomfortably higher so all the growth equities are doing better in this environment,” he said.
*****
&gt; He also said the February jobs report is important but it won’t change the Fed’s path.
*****
&gt; # Jobs, jobs, jobs
&gt; In January, 467,000 payrolls were added, and revisions announced in early February put the pace of recent job growth at about 500,000.
*****
&gt; Swonk said she expects 400,000 jobs were added in February.
*****
&gt; “We know that job postings in February picked up after a lull during the omicron wave and that should show up with more job gains in February as well. ... We also saw the ramping up for the spring break season,” the economist said, noting she expects more jobs in leisure and hospitality and gains in everything from manufacturing to professional business services.
*****
&gt; # Boiling oil
&gt; Oil prices will likely remain volatile with some strategists expecting continued gains. OPEC+ holds its monthly meeting Wednesday. Oil was lower Friday, as speculation grew that Iran could soon reach a deal on its nuclear program that would allow it to return 1 million barrels to the market.
*****
&gt; “That’s why you’ve seen the market react the way it has. There’s a decent amount of oil,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital.
*****
&gt; West Texas Intermediate crude futures were down 1% on Friday at $91.86 per barrel.
*****
&gt; # Bullish bet?
&gt; Some strategists expect the market may have set a bottom when it snapped back higher Thursday.
*****
&gt; But one investor appears to be making a big bet on a bullish move by the market.
*****
&gt; “We had an investor who was just making a very bullish bet in the S&amp;P 500, for the last three days. He doubled down on his bet today that it’s going higher,” said Cardinal Capital founder Pat Kernan on Friday.
*****
&gt; Kernan, who works in the Cboe S&amp;P 500 options pit, said the trade was a “real money” bet of more than $200 million.
*****
&gt; The investor bought 65,000 call spreads that expire every Friday between March 4 and March 25. The biggest bet was 30,000 call spreads that expire March 18, right after the Fed meeting.
*****
&gt; The breakeven price suggests the investor believes the S&amp;P 500 will be at least as high as 4,460 at that point.
*****
&gt; Kernan said the market changed totally Friday, and it had been very different earlier in the week.
*****
&gt; “It was crazy fearful two nights ago. This is one of the most bizarre markets we’ve seen, but every single down tick today, they just bought it,” he said of S&amp;P futures.

&gt; # Cold War 2.0 – Midterm Bottom Nears

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/feb25bd4cdbe0ffd38abe3b85d7ef57c/ec436ef0b8793cc1-b0/s500x750/1a889a3555ac7f2bd39bd75e8f97cd37e16a7d3c.jpg))**

&gt; In the table here we compiled the relevant historical geopolitical events that had an impact on energy prices and/or sovereign boundaries. As you can see the longer more drawn-out crises were accompanied by weaker markets. Arguably back in 2014 Putin stopped in Crimea due to plunging oil prices hurting his coffers. Our guess is he will use the same playbook or similar for the rest of Ukraine and eventually kick out the pro-western government and hold some kind of election to install and establish a new pro-Russian government.

&gt; It looks likely Russia will take over all or most of Ukraine. There will be resistance, but Ukraine’s military is no match for Russia and there is not much the west can do about it either on the ground or militarily. We just don’t have the stomach or bandwidth for it. Sure, we will battle him on the economic front with sanctions and with cyber as well as support for Ukraine and NATO, but Russia has prepared for this and has withstood it before for decades during the Cold War. We are likely looking at sanctions on Russia for many years.

&gt; However, the market showed some impressive resilience to this invasion with the big rebound yesterday and today. As we have been warning all year long this is typical midterm election action for a new president where foreign adversaries take advantage of new administration weakness and unpreparedness.

&gt; Unfortunately, our worst-case scenario has now come into play. But on the positive side it looks like the midterm bottom is nearing. When we made our 2022 Annual Forecast this past December prospects for a full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine were low. For now, expect volatility to continue through Q2 and Q3 as the market seeks support, digests the developments in Ukraine, elsewhere in the geopolitical arena and on the Fed/inflation front. We still expect the Q4 rally illustrated in our updated chart here of the S&amp;P 500 Midterm Election Year Seasonal Pattern to materialize as we approach the midterm elections in the late summer or early fall.

&gt; # Stocks Move Into A Correction

&gt; For the first time since March 2020, the S&amp;P 500 Index officially moved into a correction, down 10.3% from the recent highs. Of course, many stocks have already been in a correction, with some even in bear markets. This is yet another potential worry for investors, but should it be?

&gt; “Let’s remember the S&amp;P 500 averages about one 10% correction a year. Given it has been nearly two years without one, you could make the argument stocks were definitely due,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-1.png))**

&gt; What now? The good news is stocks do quite well after corrections. As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, this is the 33rd correction or bear market for the S&amp;P 500 since 1950. “As uncomfortable and frustrating market corrections can be, investors need to remember that future returns after such pain can bring a lot of gains,” added Ryan. In fact, after previous corrections and bear markets, the S&amp;P 500 rose nearly 90% of the time a year or two later, with very strong returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/blog-2.23.22-2.png))**

&gt; With the economy still strong and many signs of over-the-top negative sentiment, we doubt the S&amp;P 500 will move into a bear market (down 20% or more), with a major low likely coming fairly soon. Here we show all the 10-15% corrections since 1980. Again, strong future returns are normal.

&gt; # March Almanac: Stronger in Midterm Years

&gt; As part of the Best Six/Eight Months, March has historically been a solid performing month with DJIA, S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000 &amp; 2000 all advancing more than 62% of the time with average gains ranging from 0.6% by NASDAQ to 1% by S&amp;P 500. Over the recent 21-year period, March has tended to open well with gains accumulating over its first three trading days. Temporary weakness follows before moving modestly higher into mid-month through month’s end. Removing the highly volatile March’s of 2009 and 2020 from the recent 21-year chart has a minimal effect on the overall monthly pattern.

&gt; Normally a solid performing market month, March improves in midterm-election years. In midterm years March ranks: 4th best for DJIA and S&amp;P 500 and 3rd best for NASDAQ and Russell 1000 while he small-cap Russell 2000 lands at second best. DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and 2000 have been up for five of the last six midterm Marchs.

&gt; # 11 Things To Know About Russia and Ukraine

&gt; Global stock markets are selling off hard after Russian military forces attacked a broad range of targets across Ukraine last night while Russian President Putin vowed to replace Ukraine’s government. What does it all mean for stocks and the economy? “Russia invading Ukraine has added to an already tense year, with investors selling first and asking questions later,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “But it is important to know that past major geopolitical events were usually short-term market issues, especially if the economy was on solid footing.”

&gt; Here we list 11 things you need to know.
&gt; * While the market reaction is likely to be more acute than the response to Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014, the attack on American interests is less direct than Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
&gt; * Speaking of 2014, stocks and bonds in the U.S. both took that event in stride, while European stocks were considerably weaker for several weeks. Interestingly, crude oil spiked initially, then quickly sold off.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; All indexes are unmanaged and cannot be invested into directly. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

&gt; * Broader questions of the long-term impact on U.S. and European diplomatic and geopolitical goals, as well as the conflict’s impact on U.S. national interests, are significant but not in themselves market moving.
&gt; * Stock market drawdowns from geopolitical shocks average about 5% with recovery taking under two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions can be deeper and last longer.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; * We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks, but if the conflict is contained, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets.
&gt; * As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, if the economy avoids a recession after (or during) a major geopolitical event, stocks usually do just fine. “We looked at 37 major historical or geopolitical events since World War II and found that if there is no recession then stocks gain nearly 11% a year later,” explained Ryan Detrick. “The flipside is if there is a recession, stocks are down more than to 11% a year later. Given we simply don’t see a recession on the horizon due to a strong consumer and corporate earnings backdrop, this recent weakness could be an opportunity for investors.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

&gt; * Upward pressure on commodity prices, already impacted by COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions, may see a more sustained impact as economic sanctions play out and will probably be the main source of risk for possible broader economic repercussions.
&gt; * European equities have done well relative to U.S. counterparts so far this year as U.S. megacaps have stumbled, but the relative performance may stall as the crisis plays out.
&gt; * There may be some market opportunities for very active traders during the crisis, but for most investors we believe understanding the typical market response to geopolitical risks and focusing on where we’re likely to be at the end of the year rather than at the end of next week or month is likely the best response.
&gt; * Building on the note above, past market corrections of 10-15% have been followed by rather strong future performance.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.24.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**

&gt; * From a purely technical perspective, we continue to see near-term opportunities in commodity-exposed equities.

&gt; This is a very fluid situation and one that we are watching very closely. Please continue to follow LPL Research for any updates.

&gt; # What Is the VIX Index And How Has It Responded To Russia-Ukraine Conflict?

&gt; Stock markets go up and, as many newer investors are discovering in the turbulent start to this year, down. The frequency and magnitude of these price changes is known as volatility and the most frequently used measure for U.S. stock market volatility is the Cboe (Chicago Board Options Exchange) Volatility Index, commonly referred to as the VIX.

&gt; “The VIX is often referred to as the “fear gauge” because it spikes in times of market worries and when stocks go down,” explained LPL Financial Quantitative Strategist George Smith. “The escalating Russia-Ukraine conflict, combined with ongoing inflation and rate-hike concerns, are driving the VIX to the highest levels since 2020.”

&gt; The VIX is calculated by aggregating the weighted prices of put and call options placed on the S&amp;P 500 index and can be considered a measure of expected 30-day volatility in the U.S stock markets.

&gt; As shown in the LPL Chart of the Day, volatility as measured by the 1-month rolling average VIX has risen sharply in the past few weeks. It spiked twice, initially in response to worries over the pace of potential Federal Reserve rate hikes and now the Russian invasion of Ukraine (as well as continuing inflation concerns).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; As markets have digested the military escalation in Ukraine, the closing price for the VIX for the past two days has been close to 3 standard deviations above the 12-month average. At the January and February peaks, the VIX hit intraday highs of around 38 which if it had closed at those levels would been almost 5 standard deviation events.

&gt; Like many other measures of market sentiment that we monitor extreme levels of volatility have historically had the potential to be contrarian signals when it comes to predicting stocks prices over the short term. When the VIX has closed more than 3 standard deviations above its 12-month rolling average the forward returns for the S&amp;P 500 have tended to be well above average, and within the 3- to 6-month timeframe have been more likely to be positive than on average. This extreme level on the VIX last occurred on 1/25/2022.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; The VIX closing greater than 50% higher than its 1-month moving average has also been a reliable contrarian indicator – as long as it has occurred outside of recessionary periods – and this last occurred on 1/25 as well. The major caveat with this indicator is that we often don’t know that we are in a recession until after the fact so caution should be used considering the prevailing economic environment (which we don’t expect to be recessionary at the present time).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.25.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

&gt; After an extremely quiet 2021, in which the VIX was declining throughout the year, we did expect higher volatility in 2022 as often occurs at this stage of the business cycle. However, like most of the world, outside of the kremlin, we did not expect that one of the reasons for a rise in volatility would be the largest conflict in Europe since World War Two. We do expect further market volatility as the situation unfolds and elevated uncertainty may persist for several weeks depending on how the conflict develops, but as long as the conflict is contained to Ukraine, we do not expect long-lasting contagion to broader markets. Looking back at historic geopolitical shocks stock market drawdowns average about 5% with recoveries taking less than two months, but larger conflicts in sensitive regions have led to deeper and longer lasting drawdowns.

34,Watching TGT closely,"I am eagerly awaiting TGT earnings on Tuesday next week. I am long TGT and hold it as my second largest individual position. I have tremendous conviction and love the business. Over the past couple months the stock price has taken a beating and sits about 25% off it’s highs in the $260s. As the market rallied the last couple days TGT has ridden the wave up as well but remains in the $200 threshold. With solid growth and an attractive valuation next to its peers I am waiting to see if my retail darling pops after earnings. I personally am betting on seeing strong revenues and solid forecasts but am concerned earnings might have taken a hit due to increased costs that target is trying not to pass on to consumers.

At these prices target looks like an attractive buy to me and I am very curious to see if buying continues on Monday into earnings and what he report looks like Tuesday.

Anyone else watching or buying?",stocks,1645880828
35,Will China Follow Suit with Russia?,"China has an opportunity to improve its standing in the world amidst the Russian Ukraine crisis. They can choose aggression (with Taiwan for example) or they can sit back and let Russia be in the spotlight and witness the world’s response. Not that China necessarily cares what the world thinks of them, but rather they are smart enough to know they need the world economically. Furthermore, building their economic strength affords them superpower status without firing a shot. This is a far less painful and risky approach, particularly since the western nations will not invade for the sake of growing an empire. Of course the definition of defensive or offensive military action is decided in the eye of the beholder. But nonetheless China could help mitigate tensions with the West and at the same time prosper along side investors in their markets. Only time will tell but viewpoints welcome.",stocks,1645880551

I only started buying stocks recently (2020/2021) along with many others who don’t know what their doing. I’m going to keep it real….I HATE researching stocks! I couldn’t care less about PE ratios, forward or backwards, market share etc etc..(and whatever ever else people look at to evaluate companies and stocks). Rather … I simply ‘believe’ in a sector ex. EV’s, Pot stocks, metaverse and then just buy individual stocks I think might be related or involved in that sector in the future.  That’s it. No research. No crunching number, no reading reports of any kind. 

As one might expect I’ve racked up a hodge podge disjointed stocks, many down significantly. Down like 50-70% in some cases. I don’t even know if I should hold them or sell them at this point? I don’t know how to properly evaluate companies, and beyond that I have very little interest in doing that. 

Honest question, is it ok for me to continue to buy stocks? Or must you always do due diligence and go over each company with a fine tooth comb (which I don’t know how to do). Or should I just skip individual stock investments altogether buy more diverse ETF’s and mutual funds?",stocks,1645873344

When you think of a stereotypical 90s movie about stock brokers, it is always portrayed as a hectic large office with people all tuning in to this magical big screen that tells them the stock prices, which are fluctuating every split second. But what actually determines those prices? Who or what decides that company x will now be priced 0.0001 cent higher than a second ago. Those numbers don't magically appear, there has to be either a person or an algorithm deciding what those numbers will say. I'm assuming nowadays it will be an algorithm, one that factors in supply and demand. But who makes the algorithm? And how does it account for the various streams of information? What factors are part of the equation?

2. Given revenue hit from Apple/Google new security features this another reason why the Enterprise pivot is all the more crucial
3. With 600M users (w/16M being paying users) DBX would provide Meta with a significant leg up as they try to compete in the Enterprise space
4. Since DBX is platform agnostic, Meta would gain instant access to Apple/Google users plus a ton of data insights into usage
5. From a culture perspective, Meta makes more sense than the Oracle's of the world

99,Great news!!! SEC proposes new rule requiring short-sellers to disclose their positions monthly,"Gary Gensler has been circling short-sellers for months, and now the Securities and Exchange Commission chief is looking to make a big move. Under a new rule proposed by the SEC Friday morning, some investors would be required to report their short sale-related activity to the SEC on a monthly basis, allowing the commission to make detailed short-selling data available to the public for the first time.

“Today, the Commission unanimously voted to propose rules and amendments to broaden the scope of short sale-related data available to the investing public and to regulators,” Gensler said in a statement. “If adopted, it would strengthen transparency of an important area of our markets that would benefit from greater visibility and oversight.”

Since taking the reins at SEC, Gensler has made market transparency a key goal, and short-selling has been a major area of discussion, including after the wild short squeeze that took hold in January 2021 on meme stocks like GameStop GME, -5.80% and AMC Entertainment AMC, -3.90%. The fallout from the short squeeze resulted in a Congressional hearing and an SEC investigation. While the probe did not find any actual malfeasance, Gensler has been hinting that he still was monitoring short-sellers. In February, Bloomberg News reported on a sweeping Department of Justice probe of at least 30 short-selling firms and allies.

Retail investors have complained that more shares are being shorted than are available to trade, while keeping alive online discussions claiming market manipulation, potential fraud by short-sellers and the lack of data publicly available around short-seller trading activity. Under current rules, firms are required to report short interest data to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority twice a month. Critics have said the quality and frequency of that data isn’t highly useful. The SEC’s proposed new rule will look to bridge that gap.

While the changes to previously proposed SEC rules have been common, as written Rule 13f-2, would only apply to institutional investment managers that hold “a short position of at least $10 million or the equivalent of 2.5 percent or more of the total shares outstanding” in an individual security, meaning that the SEC would be able to see and share the biggest short sales of individual stocks and aggregate them, providing investors with granular data on those shorts. Firms also would have two weeks into every month to disclose, giving essentially a detailed 6-week lookback at big short moves and give a much clearer, if month-old, picture of short interest on stocks.

The rule, as designed, would increase disclosure of what is known as “buy-to-cover,” essentially when a trader initiates a buy trade to close their short position on borrowed shares, something that short-selling critics likely will welcome as it would aim to further curb so-called “naked shorting,” a practice the SEC mostly outlawed in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis for traders using non-existent shares to short stock of public companies. Overall, the new transparency rule is yet another push by Gensler to bring more market data out of the dark corners and into the light.

As he told MarketWatch in an exclusive interview last week, “Finance is ultimately about trust, and the official sector has a role to help instill that trust through a set of rules on disclosure, anti-fraud and anti-manipulation.”

The company operates through their **different subsidiaries, Troika, Mission, Troika Labs, and** [**Troika.io**](https://troika.io/) **and have offices across America, as well as London.**

# Robert B Machinist

Troika is being led by **Robert B. Machinist,** who is currently the Chairman and CEO of the company. Mr. Machinist has held many different C-suite level positions in his lifetime and brings extensive experience in investment banking and M&amp;A. Prior to his time at Troika he took a variation of professions:

* Vice Chairman of Pyrolyx A.G.
* Chairman and was an original founding Board Member of CIFC Corp. (CIFC)
* A partner in multiple different private investment funds
* Run a private family investment company

Valuation

Troika saw their **YOY revenue increase 102% for the first quarter of the fiscal year 2022,** and more impressively had their **adjusted EBITDA improve by 78%.** Top line revenue reached **$8.3 million, leading to a net loss of $2.1 million, which marks a 45% improvement YOY.** The company has a cash balance of little over $9 million and with a market cap of $54 million Troika trades at only 3 times sales. **The post Covid recovery is well underway and as we move into 2022 Troika is well positioned to have one their strongest years yet.** As well, the company is well off their 52-week high of **$4 per share and is operating in a multibillion-dollar industry.** All this is leading to **Troika being** **fundamentally undervalued** when taking into consideration improving margins, great top line growth, and deep connections with high spending clients.

# Final Thoughts

When you look at the stock price, it seems to embody the struggle Troika has gone through over the course of 2021. This was largely the result of unfavorable market conditions and the inability for companies to allocate capital towards marketing campaigns. Troika took this as an opportunity however, and learned how to cut costs and operate much more efficiently. Now, with serious traction coming from large organizations looking to return their marketing budgets back to pre-covid levels the company is now ready to capitalize. As well, Troika has committed to the digital revolution currently taking place and is ready to help guide their clients into this new virtual realm.

Financials are showing growth on all fronts and the company has ample cash to pursue acquisition opportunities. **Today, the company is showing signs of being materially undervalued and is providing major upside going into 2022.** Troika showed they can persevere when times are tough, but now the worst is behind them, and they are coming into the new year ready to execute. Investors should without a doubt have Troika on their watchlists.",stocks,1645800653

56,Just Eat Takeaway - DD,"**Profile:** 

Just Eat Takeaway.com NV, is a company based in the Netherlands that provides an online food delivery service (Just Eat provide their own riders to deliver the food) and an online food delivery marketplace (a marketplace that allows restaurants to deliver food with their own riders for a fee). The Company focuses on connecting consumers and restaurants, and allows users to order food from nearby restaurants and have the food delivered to their homes.[\[1\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn1) They operate in 4 key regions: North America (41% of Business), Northern Europe (26%), UK &amp; Ireland (23%), Southern Europe &amp; ANZ (10%). The company started solely as a marketplace, but has since evolved to provide their own service, while maintaining the original model as well. 

**Opportunity:**

Just Eat Takeaway has had a turbulent past year. Like many food delivery stocks, they benefited greatly during lockdowns as people were forced to stay at home and order food online rather than go to restaurants. This created a surge in demand for their services. Since then, there has been a culmination of macro-economic changes that directly affect profitability and performance of delivery companies: European delivery stocks dropping after the EU announced changes in regulation around gig workers, North American delivery stocks dropping after NYC and Canada imposed caps on commission[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn2), and a rising interest rate environment. The troubles don’t end here with TKWY as there is a market view that they overpaid for Grubhub and is overreaching by shifting focus away from their core EU hub. Additionally, there has been miscommunication on strategy with the CEO changing his mind on grocery delivery.[\[3\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn3) 

Since all of this Just Eat Takeaway has dropped 70% since the highs in October 2020 and perhaps the stock market is too pessimistic about it. At current levels, the stock is looking very attractive and there exists a possibility to purchase a company at a very low valuation. In this report, I lay out why despite all the downside, the stock is now a great buying opportunity. 

**Valuation:**

At current valuation, their EV is around 8.1bn Eur. In their annual report of 2020, management has mentioned that their 33% stake in the company iFood has received multiple offers including one for 2.3bn Eur[\[4\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn4). Assuming that it is still accurate, that puts the remaining value of the company at 5.8bn Eur. In 2021, the company paid 7.3bn USD for Grubhub, which in turn translates to 6.45bn Eur. Accounting for a current net debt position of 0.7bn Eur the current price puts the remaining operations of Just eat at -1.3bn Eur. **Meaning you are being paid to take on the European business with 16bn+ Eur GMV**. (GMV – gross merchandise value/volume, also referred to as GTV – gross transaction volume)

An argument can be made that recently these valuations for Grubhub and iFood are quite high and do not meet reality. If we assume a 60% reduction in value for both cases, that comes to a remaining EV of 4.6bn Eur for the entire European business. This still comes at the low end of its historic multiples. On the other hand, if the stake in iFood and/or Grubhub has since increased, valuation could be even cheaper. 

**Trading at historic low valuations:**

Just eat is trading at the same price it traded in May 2017. Since then, it has grown revenue from 166 million Eur to over 3 billion Eur and GMV from 1.3 billion to 28.2 billion Eur[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn5). It perhaps traded too highly in those previous periods, nonetheless, a return to a fraction of these valuations would present an opportunity to make returns of 100%+. It should also be noted that since then, a lot of M&amp;A has occurred, meaning shareholders have had their shares diluted. Thus, comparing the two valuations is not so straight forward and should be taken with some scepticism.

In Netherlands and Germany, the company has proved that it can generate 5% net adjusted EBITDA on GMV[\[6\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn6). If (and big if) they are able to achieve this steady state, then that would imply EBITDA of 800mn Eur on their European business. After 20% tax rate, that is 640mn Eur earnings assuming negligible D&amp;A and with current balance sheet debt holding at very low values. A conservation 10PE ratio would put that at 6.4bn which already is higher than the current market share at which the entire company is trading at right now (excluding iFoods). 

Long-term best-case scenario could include that GMV will continue to grow at mid teen digits[\[7\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn7) (assuming 15%) for 5 years –&gt; 1.15\^5= 200% over 5 years. Therefore, GMV would be around 56bn. A 4% Net Income margin would assume earnings of around 2.2bn Eur. 

It should be noted that this assumes they will be able to achieve the promised land of 5% adjusted EBITDA to GMV as well as no execution risk or any other risks involved. On the other hand, it is a conservative ratio potentially implying a higher valuation. 

Furthermore, as market trend moved from very bullish on food delivery companies and paying several multiples for GMV to now paying only a fraction for GMV, the trend could reverse, and these companies could see renewed upside. Trading at 1 GMV would imply a 300%+ upside. 

Such a recent large sell off in their stock could be proven to be an overreaction and a great opportunity to buy a company selling below intrinsic value. “Large amounts of money aren’t made by buying what everybody likes. They’re made by buying what everybody underestimates.” – Howard marks.

**Other Funds positions**

Cat Rock is particularly bullish on them with a sizeable position as well as Baupost[\[8\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn8). Cat Rock has released a few presentations with how they can unlock a huge amount of value by partnering with certain companies and tapping into the same day delivery market. Additionally, they propose the sale of Grubhub (the US part of operations)[\[9\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn9), and go into more depth on growth, app ratings, addressable market, independent restaurants, etc. 

**Other points, risks and bear case:**

1. The company is loss making 

a. As the company is focussing on growth, it currently is investing heavily and trying to grow market share and revenue. Management said long term goals is to achieve &gt;5% adjusted EBITDA margins on GMV. [\[10\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn10) For 2022, they are expect to come in the range of approx. -1.2% of GMV with this year being the biggest losses. For next year they are aiming at -0.6% to -0.8% EBITDA margin to GMV. It is still to be seen if they can achieve their long-term profitability. This is perhaps the most significant downside as you are paying for promised earnings in the future rather than current earnings with other companies. 

2. It is trading at an elevated PS multiple compared to the market

a. Trading at about 1.75x PS ratio[\[11\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn11), argument can be made that Just Eat is somewhat under-priced compared to the SP500 and major indices.[\[12\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn12)

3. Growth will slow down in 2022 and beyond

a. Growth will decrease in the following years, however, they are still expecting to grow in the mid teen digits. 

b. Additionally, it is expected that food delivery is just another pandemic trend that will decrease. The company is still expecting growth in this sector as well as some news sources[\[13\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn13), as habits have formed. Even as people do go back to restaurants and eating out during weekends, with working from home staying, certain habits will remain. The extent of this is still to be seen.

4. Regulation will hurt margins

a. Just Eat will in fact significantly benefit from the recent regulatory changes in Europe. Europe wants to recognise gig workers and riders as workers (so that they get benefits, sick leave, etc.) which would hurt many food delivery business models.[\[14\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn14) However, Just Eat already employs their riders as workers in most European cities and is one step ahead of regulation. This change will in fact benefit them as it could force some competitors out of business as they will not be able to keep operating at such low costs. This is perhaps one of the most significant potential upsides this company has over competitors in Europe. 

5. Highly competitive market

a. A key advantage for Just Eat over Deliveroo, Uber and others is that Just Eat started and continues to operate a marketplace as well to employ riders unlike the competitors. Many restaurants still deliver with their own network of riders rather than paying the fees for hiring the platform, which means that Just Eat can take a cut of the GMV which is at a much higher margin. Therefore, they have a comparative advantage compared to other companies where they can offer logistics solutions that others do not. 

b. That being said, the market is very crowded, and the competition is fierce with many companies investing significant amounts of money to capture market share.

c. This presentation with slightly outdated values intended for Deliveroo inadvertently highlights the cheapness of Just Eat before an increase in GMV and decrease in market cap.[\[15\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/submit#_ftn15)  

6. Rising interest rates will hurt growth and their “promised earnings”

a. Rising interest rates will hurt their long-term prospects of the value of their earnings and potential to raise capital. However, an argument can be made that the market has already priced that in, especially after a 60%+ drop and bond yields elevated.

7. Short term – Russian Ukraine conflict

a. This conflict though can be serious, but will unlikely lead to WW3 and all nations joining in. This will be primarily limited to Ukraine/Russia where the target market is minimal/non-existent. Potentially, a recent market overreaction.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

70,Analysis on why the stock market rallied today and how you should be thinking,"Too many people on reddit dont really know what is going on in the market, so I will break it down for you.  I will analyze and give you some food for though as to how to move foward and also what the big traders are doing.

Im going to break this down into 4 parts to make this easy to understand:

1.  rate hike easement (market expectation)  banks/ yields/bonds
2. technicals  (oversold conditions on RSI, double bottom)
3. VIX and TNX
4. What the whales are doing

You might be asking why the market rallied when Russia just invaded Ukraine.  The simple answer is, bad news is good news for the market and good news is bad for the market.  With geo political escalation the vix shot up and the market dropped.  VIX otherwise known as the fear index shot up to insane levels on the news of escalation, but on the day of the invasion the stock rose.  The reason is simple, first there was fear and the vix shot up, the algos and daytraders pick up on this and trade accordingly.

Now lets look at the reasons why it rallied, as that is what most of you dont understand.  Like I said, bad news is good news for the market.  If we have war, there will be a easing of the rate hikes.  Instead of 50 basis points, we could be looking at 25.  Also we are trading expectations.  Or in this case we are pricing in a smaller rate hike.  

This is part of the reason why banks also dropped today.  Expectations of less then 50 basis point hike lessened and algos follow the TNX when trading bank stocks.

Also what was one of the biggest fears in the market, which is the sanctions which will not only hurt them but really hurt our own economy.  Think Oil, paladium, wheat, etc.  The sanctions were basically weaksauce.  This was probably one of the biggest fears going into this geo political escalation.  its also why there was so much bullish calls on Oil, fertilizer, wheat, paladium, etc.  And why you see oil drop back.  Commodities like wheat had other factors helping it so it didnt tank like oil did.  

Now lets look at it from a technical stand point.  I predicted this rally and  posted it 24 hours before the rally today, as to why we had a good shot at rallying on my discord.  What we experienced today was a combination of rate easing expecations and also from extreme oversold conditions.  

How does oversold conditions play into this you might ask.  From a trading stand point.  As someone who is shorting, you want to exit right before or at RSI levels of 30 or lower.  This is what we call profit taking.  In order to profit take on a short, you have to buy back the shares you borrowed, creating buying pressure.  So when the shorts cover by profit taking and dip buyers appearing on oversold conditions and a easing of rate hike, that is going to lead to a extreme rally.  

This happens in every bearish market and is known as a bearish rally.  Normally we get a pop for a couple days and then back to the downward trend.

A big part of the equation to the rally is stock rotation (transitory/temporary).  This means we found a tradeable bottom.  What we did today was SELLING THE WINNERS AND BUYING THE LOSERS.  If you look at the heatmap, you will notice the stocks that performed the best were the ones who were sold off the most.  

The last and final part of the rally is the VIX topping and TNX moving down.  When yields fall, growth stock does well, especially when they are sold off to extreme levels.  VIX moving down also pushes the market higher, we will still be trading above the 20, so still in fear territory, but we moved down from the peak of 38.  You see both of these macro indicators moving down, its a good case for a bullish market movement, especially when you consider all the other things I listed above.  You combine them and this is what you get.

As you can see from option activity, this is going to be a short term rally.  The whales are shorting SPY, QQQ, and real estate for expiration dates in april and may (rate hikes negatively affect this sector and is a proxy for yields in a way) 

They are going long Emerging markets (EMM) and seems to be the party favorite right now.  The other is to go long value stock that has pricing power.  Think transportation stocks like union pacific, fed ex, etc.  Any company that has sound fundamentals, cash flow, and a monopoly.

The other long position is in commodities, such as oil, metals, agricultural.  This is basically the best hedge vs rising inflation and stagflation.",stocks,1645778030

77,Fed’s Waller wants to leave door open for possible half-point rate hike on March 16,"The Federal Reserve should not rule out raising its policy interest rate by half of one percentage point on March 16, especially if incoming inflation and jobs data released before then show the economy is running “exceedingly hot,” said Fed Gov. Christopher Waller on Thursday.

The government will release two key inflation reports and a jobs report prior to the Fed meeting. The first of these key reports, the January reading of the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — the personal consumption expenditure price index — will come early Friday morning.

“If…tomorrow’s PCE inflation report for January and jobs and CPI reports for February indicate that the economy is still running exceedingly hot, a strong case can be made for a 50-basis-point hike in March,” Waller said, in remarks to a conference on economic forecasting sponsored by the University of California, Santa Barbara.

“With the economy at full employment and inflation far above target, we should signal we are moving back to neutral at a fast pace, based on the performance of the economy, and a 50-basis-point hike would help do that,” he said.

# Inflation outlook

Waller said that all Americans “should be alarmed” by the latest consumer price inflation data, which showed inflation running at a 7.5% annual rate in January, a 40-year high.

The Fed governor said he was “alarmed about the level of inflation and a bit uncertain about how the near-term may play out,” but hopeful that supply-chain bottlenecks and shortages will begin to ease after June, and that inflation — with some help from the Fed — will come down significantly by year’s end.

Given this outlook, Waller said he now supports increasing the Fed’s policy interest rate by 100 basis points by the middle of the year, up to a target range of 1% to 1.25%.

This could be accomplished with four quarter-point hikes at each of the Fed’s next four meetings, he said.

But “front-loading” a 50-basis-point hike may be useful to convey the Fed’s determination to address high inflation, he said.

# Ukraine invasion’s effect on rate hikes

On Wednesday[, traders lowered their expectations of a half-point hike on March 16, ](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/economic-impact-from-war-between-russia-and-ukraine-seen-as-limited-for-u-s-11645548528?mod=search_headline&amp;mod=article_inline)in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some other Fed officials expressed more caution about such a large initial hike.

Waller said it is possible that the state of the world will be different in the wake of the Ukraine attack and “that may mean that a more modest tightening is appropriate.”

“But that remains to be seen,” and the uncertainty may last beyond the March 16 meeting, he added.

Waller said that the Ukraine situation did not obviate the need to raise rates next month.

“We need to take the first step in March,” he said, adding that the geopolitical situation would be a factor in the pace of further rate hikes.

# Trimming the balance sheet

Waller also said he wanted the Fed to start to shrink its $9 trillion balance sheet no later than its July meeting.

Other Fed officials have not been as specific about the timing.

The Fed allows its balance sheet to shrink by letting maturing securities run off. During the last cycle, the Fed set monthly caps on the runoff that started small and then grew over time.

Waller said the caps can be larger in this cycle. At some point, the Fed will need to consider selling some of its mortgage-backed securities, but that is a decision for “down the road.” For now, Waller said only that the Fed shouldn’t cap the runoff of maturing MBS.

# Powell testimony

“These actions will get us into the second half of the year, when we will have six months of inflation data, and we can assess what the appropriate path will be for the rest of 2022,” Waller said.

If high inflation persists, Waller said he would mostly likely support continued hikes — and potentially at a faster pace.

Until recently, Waller was seen by Fed watchers as at the hawkish end of the spectrum of Fed officials.

But the doves on the Fed have shifted in his direction. Economists will be listening closely next Wednesday and Thursday when Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies to lawmakers to see where the center of the committee stands on interest-rate policy.

First of all, please don't put your eggs in the same basket. I think we should implement a diversified investment strategy, the greatest investment strategy of the 20th century.

From a long-term investment perspective, the best diversification strategies are comprehensive, including diversification against inflation, financial crises, and social unrest.

&amp;#x200B;

At the same time, we see that the stock market is not always safe in times of social unrest, inflation and financial crises. At this time, gold and energy are safer and more reliable than the stock market, and gold is the best safe-haven currency. Therefore, it is always best to invest some of your funds in the gold and energy markets.

&amp;#x200B;

In summary, there are the following strategies:

1. We can selectively invest 30% of our capital in the stock market. In the stock market, we still follow a diversified investment strategy. Including technology stocks, energy stocks, consumer stocks, financial stocks, medical stocks, etc., you can refer to MSFT, AAPL, CO, TSLA, XOM, etc. (it is best to buy after a big drop);

2. Invest 30% of the funds to directly purchase gold and crude oil. These investments cannot be replaced by gold stocks and crude oil stocks, because stocks still represent corporate behavior, and we should invest directly in the commodity itself;

3. Invest 20% in mutual funds and ETFs, my explanation is: the fund itself is a diversified portfolio, but when the market goes up, stocks will always be more profitable than funds. Buying some funds is mainly for the volatility and downside risks that may arise in the bear market.

4. If you invest in the current form, please reserve 20% of the funds as a safety reserve. When the financial crisis hits, this part of the money is the money you buy again.

&amp;#x200B;

Risks in the market are diverse, you can never predict when a risk will occur, and you never know where a risk will occur.

Analyze the actual situation and apologize for any inaccuracies.

My lessons:

1. I was a bull market genius. I don't much about reading financial statements and really analyzing the businesses.

2. I can't barely follow 3 companies properly, then how can I invest in 10+ companies? Makes zero sense.

3. Luckily $QQQ is also down 20%. So, I just moved all of my proceeds to QQQ. I am 100% sure someday in next 10 years it will go back to ATH. Can't say the same about my stocks.

4. I was spending 10 hours on Twitter/Reddit on stocks. Now I get 10 hours back every week.

5. I really understand why people say 95% of us should just buy index funds.

15,You know F is fucked when their own CEO is reiterating the same points TSLA bulls use.,"Here are some fun comments he made: 

""Farley told the Wolfe Research virtual global auto technology conference Feb. 23 that the company could hit Tesla-like profit margins by using common electric motors, electronic components and other parts across all sizes of vehicles.

But to do that, Ford needs radically different human talent than it now has, Farley said in a surprisingly candid interview with analyst Rod Lache. He also said the company has too many people and too much complexity, and it doesn’t have the expertise to transition to battery-electric vehicles.

Ford, Farley said, can’t just pivot from internal combustion engines to battery-powered vehicles

But “I can’t turn to the ICE organization and say ‘go be Tesla.’ They may do it on the (auto) body. They may do it in plant operations, but that’s not good enough,” he said, without giving specifics of what changes are coming.""

&amp;#x200B;

Combine this with new reports that Tesla could be building a Giga Shanghai factory 2.0 to eventually reach a production output of 2M vehicles a year it doesn't look great for legacy auto. Keep in mind using January numbers Tesla is already at a run rate of 840k in Shanghai and is increasing its Fremont capacity from 400k to 600k. With Austin and Berlin just around the corner, 1.6M does not seem unreasonable this year by any margin.

17,DigitalOcean Stock Rallies on Strong Growth in Cloud Services for the Little Guy,"https://www.barrons.com/articles/digitalocean-stock-earnings-cloud-services-51645728040

DigitalOcean Holdings has been floating on quiet seas since its initial public offering last March. The cloud services provider for small businesses came public at $47 a share, and lately has been trading right around that level.

But DigitalOcean (ticker: DOCN) is beginning to attract some investor attention. Earlier Thursday, the company posted solid fourth quarter financial results, and CEO Yancey Spruill sees multiple years of substantial growth ahead.

For the quarter, DigitalOcean reported revenue of $119.7 million, up 37% from a year ago, and just above the former Wall Street consensus call of $119.1 million. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 10 cents a share, a penny better than analysts anticipated. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization were $37.8 million, while annual run-rate revenue, or ARR, was $490 million, also up 37%.

Thursday afternoon, DigitalOcean shares were up 7.7% to $50.56.

For the March quarter, the company expects revenue of $126 million to $126.5 million, with non-GAAP profits of 10 to 12 cents a share, while the Street consensus had been for $126.2 million and 11 cents. For the full year, DigitalOcean projects revenue of $564 million to $568 million, with non-GAAP profits of 70 to 71 cents a share. The former Street consensus call was for $563 million of revenue and a profit of 58 cents a share.

DigitalOcean is a sort of mini version of Amazon.com ‘s (AMZN) Amazon Web Services, providing cloud-computing capability to very small businesses. In the latest quarter, average revenue per customer was $65.87, up 29% from a year earlier. The company now has 609,000 customers, with 99,000 of them paying more than $50 a month. In an interview with Barron’s, Spruill noted that the company had a net dollar retention rate—a measure of repeat business—of 116% in the quarter, up from 105% a year earlier.

Spruill thinks the opportunity to provide cloud services to small businesses is vast. He thinks the company can hit $1 billion in revenue by 2024, with a long-term target of sustaining growth over 30%. 

In reporting results, the company also announced a $300 million stock repurchase plan—a fairly unusual move for a company just one year into its public market journey.

Spruill noted that the company is achieving positive free cash flow, and getting more profitable. While free cash flow was 6% of revenue last year, it should reach 8% to 10% this year, he said.

The company exited the year with $1.7 billion in cash, which is about 30% of the company’s market cap, Spruill said, noting that many of the company’s peers in the cloud-based software sector won’t be cash-flow positive for years to come.

Spruill said that while the DigitalOcean offering isn’t as rich in terms of features as what is available from Amazon Web Services and similar large providers, it doesn’t need to be for smaller customers with simpler needs. “We have customers who come to us every month from the hyperscalers,” he says. “It’s a better experience, and they save a lot of money.”",stocks,1645754887

23,Block (Square) Stock Jumps +18% AH After Earnings Top Estimates Amid Afterpay Acquisition,"Square-parent Block (SQ) reported December-quarter earnings, net revenue and gross payment volume that topped analyst estimates, despite growth slowing for consumer Cash App services. SQ stock jumped in extended trading amid updated guidance amid the acquisition of Afterpay.

San Francisco-based Block reported fourth-quarter earnings late Thursday. SQ stock initially fell on the earnings release. But after the earnings call with Wall Street analysts, Square stock jumped 21% to near 155 in extended trading on the stock market today.

Square earnings came in at 27 cents per adjusted share, down 15% from 32 cents in the year-earlier period. Analysts had projected earnings of 23 cents a share.

Gross profit increased 47% to $1.18 billion vs. estimates of $1.16 billion, the company said.

Square said net revenue jumped 62% to $4.42 billion, boosted by Cash App transactions for digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Analysts had predicted revenue of $4.04 billion.

Gross payment volume from merchant customers rose 92% to $46.3 billion, in line with estimates. But gross payment volume growth is expected to slow in the March quarter.

Square said earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, known as EBITDA, came in at $184 million vs. estimates of $143 million.

Square on Jan. 31 closed the acquisition of Australia-based consumer lending startup Afterpay. Announced on Aug. 1, the deal was originally valued at $29 billion. With the big drop in Block stock, the deal was valued at less than $15 billion at closing.

Afterpay competes in the emerging ""buy now, pay later"" market that encroaches on credit card networks.

Also on the contrary, the situation pushed the Biden administration to use more oil reserves to balance the price. USOIL price saw a sharp decline after the news.

74,$GRPN - A Steal of a Deal (DD),"# KEY POINTS

* GRPN operating business extremely undervalued
   * Ex-SumUp investment, core biz trading at Fwd P/E 1.5x
* Key inflection point in 1Q22 as crisis era restructuring complete
* Strong EPS Growth '22 leveraged to reopening, significant FCF growth expected
* Analyst Upside 67% despite currently poor sentiment
* \~20% SI, reversal will pressure short cover scramble in current market environment
* Next ER is Feb 28 (AMC)

# Company Description

Groupon operates an online marketplace for deals on local goods, services, travel, and attractions. Revenue is driven by commissions from sellers, with 60% of gross sales coming from North America. The company also has substantial holdings in equity investments, with their SumUp (fintech) assets estimated at approx $500m alone (current GRPN mkt cap \~$640m). The company brought on the former Zappos CEO as a permanent CEO in 4Q21, replacing the interim CEO.

# Thesis

GRPN shares are severely undervalued, especially when accounting for equity investments in Sum-Up (valued at approx $18/GRPN). Ex-investments, GRPN's operating business is currently valued at a Fwd P/E 1.55, Fwd PEG of 0.038, and Fwd P/S of 0.12; in its entirety (inc. investments), GRPN is valued at Fwd P/E 10.9, Fwd PEG 0.267, and Fwd P/S of 0.68, still insanely good. For comparison, Peabody Energy (ticker BTU, a US coal company) currently trades at a Fwd P/E of 6.36 and Fwd P/S of 0.54. Fundamentally, this company screens extremely well.

Like many companies, GRPN initiated a strategy shift and cost restructuring starting in 2020 (with related impairments occurring through 4Q21) that is finally nearing an inflection point for their business rebound. Despite impairments ending in 2021, the company is expected to continue realizing an additional $225m in cost savings in 2022. Coincidentally, this is also occurring as covid restrictions are easing. Both the restructuring and the ""post-covid normalization"" are intersecting at the perfect moment to supercharge the company's profitability as Americans return to activities outside the home and merchants return to the platform.

Additionally, they revised their accounting methods in 2020 to better account for their goods strategy which has been a drag on revenue comps in 2021, but will normalize in 2022 as it laps quarters since the change was implemented.

In Q3, the company also entered new partnerships with Google Pay and Square for distribution of inventory, a major win in increasing their audience that will help drive increasing volume.

The company just brought on a new CEO, Kedar Deshpande (former CEO of Zappos), and it's possible that he resets financials. However, I'd assign a low probability to this given that financials have already been reset over the restructuring period.

It's also worth noting that GRPN has a strong record of surpassing analyst estimates over the covid period, and as long as analysts stay cautiously optimistic, they're likely set up to continue leaping over the low bar. Given how depressed estimates are, this may allow them to overcome a key risk that earnings may be volatile following the Omicron surge in Dec-Jan in the US, though this may be neutralized by guidance commentary as the surge is a month behind us and there is likely more clarity on the road ahead.

There is also a high short interest on GRPN stock (\~19% of float) that has lazily remained in the stock as a short momentum play. Given this type of inflection point for the underlying business combined with the current market environment leading HFs to crowd into shorts, a strong rally on GRPN fundamentals from here would likely lead to an acceleration of short covering, driving the stock closer to fair value in a relatively short amount of time.

Tldr: GRPN severely undervalued, has a ton of hidden value from investments, and is at a key inflection point exiting a restructuring at the same time that demand should flow back to the platform. Sentiment is still cautious enough to create a phenomenal entry point, while short interest is extremely high, creating a potential short cover as lazy momentum shorts unwind.

# Current Valuation &amp; Financials

Fwd P/S ’22: 0.67

Revenue Growth Est: 0% '22, 7% '23

* Revenue is expected to stabilize in 2022, though I suspect this is a great setup for continued upside surprises, boosted by the Things to Do and Beauty Goods verticals that are leveraged to easing covid restrictions.

Fwd P/E 10.9

EPS Growth Est: +41% '22

* EPS expected to inflect higher as cost restructuring gains take hold and revenue stabilizes &amp; accelerates as the world reopens post-covid and merchants return to the platform.

Fwd EV/EBITDA: 3.05

EBITDA Growth Est: 27% '22, 13% '23

* Strong EBITDA growth a direct result of cost restructuring and continued cost improvements. GRPN has used the pandemic crisis to shift strategies and drastically improve efficiency of operations and profitability.

Free Cash Flow Generation: +140% YoY '22

* FCF is expected to turn positive in '22 for the first time since 2019. GRPN currently trades at a 12% Fwd FCF Yield, very high for a growth stock inflecting to reaccelerate revenues. 4Q21 FCF is expected to grow at 290% YoY, with 1Q22 expected to be the first decisively positive FCF Q1 ever.

Equity Investments

* Equity investments are the 1000lb elephant in the room. The latest earnings report revalued LT investments at $123m on the balance sheet, though in Jan 2022, it was reported that SumUp (of which GRPN own's 2.4%) was preparing to raise an funding round at a $22bil valuation. If successful at this valuation, their equity position in Sumup would equate to approx 528m, increasing their investments by over 4x. In turn, their balance sheet equity would actually equate to a higher total value than their current market cap.

Analyst Price Target: $37, +67.6% upside

* Analysts have gone stale, with 60% of PTs updated prior to 2022. By leaving GRPN in the cold on updates to institutional investors, this has created opportunities once the company reports on Feb 28 for models to be revised higher and sell-side sentiment to suddenly become more optimistic given the current inflection point.
   * Barclays stated valuation is currently ""rock bottom"" and expects the marketing strategy to generate growth near term, though is waiting for confirmation of continued momentum before upgrading the stock from underweight.
   * JPMorgan is also cautiously optimistic that the 2020-21 restructuring efforts are about to pay off through higher growth and a more profitable business.
   * A recent report by Prescience Point Capital Mgmt established a longer-term fair value range of $69-100+ when accounting for the operating business and investments.

# How to Play

All positions provide the highest aggregate returns at the lowest strike price in their tenor. Returns presented as profit (i.e. 2x = 200% profit, 300% original cost). Recent highs of $31 on 2/1/22; 2H21 high of $45.

* Stock! No brainer. Big returns to be had for the swing trade.
* Risk-Averse: Jul '22 C22. On a run to 35, these return 2x; continued momentum above 40 returns at least 3x.
* Quasi-Risk Averse: Apr '22 C25. Offers profit of 1.8x-7.5x on a run to $30 or a break toward $40.
* WSB Delight: Mar '22 C25. Offers profit of 3x-7x on run to $30 or a break toward $35.",stocks,1645733147
75,War and the US Market,"

I thought this was interesting after this evenings crawl back in the S&amp;P500.

War is no unheard of thing to the US, since 9/11 over $6.4T has been spent on war.
From the US market past, the S&amp;P500 actually gained 50% over the years of
WWII. That's 7% annualised. Over the two largest wars ever heard of, it gained around 115%.

However, during the pre-war phase, the market did indeed have a poo, but after the 'prelude' of this conflict, they go back to their normal business!

So gentlemen. After this panic, and as possibly seen this evening the S&amp;P500 it should start to crawl back.

I also remember that Intel started moving its chip production back to Mainland America and one of the reasons stated was for 'security'. This morning, Taiwan and China's air force were having skirmishes. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) produces chips for literally almost everything from your game consoles to cars. It is very obvious from that alone that Taiwan is the #1 target for China nevermind the history between the two along with China's precedent for taking Hong Kong. 

If China invades Taiwan with the combination of the Russian invasion, WW3 would very likely be on the table where they would be fighting back to back on the European and Pacific fronts like Germany and Japan, but without a common enemy between the two. In that scenario, Taiwan would be as good as gone and everywhere else in the world would be cutoff from its chip production. Where would the US get its chips? Possibly from the chip manufacturer that is moving all its production to the mainland. There could even be a scenario where Intel gets massive funding from the government to rapidly ramp up its production. 

That's my bull case anyway. I'd like to know any counterarguments or details I overlooked.",stocks,1645726066

Is this the correct approach? Any tips greatly appreciated, choosing different averages Ofc give big differences.

South Jersey Industries Inc. SJI, 40.12% said Thursday it has entered an agreement to be acquired by the Infrastructure Investments Fund, a private vehicle, in a deal with an enterprise value of about $8.1 billion. **Under the term of the deal, IIF will pay $36 for each SJI share owned, equal to a premium of 46.3% over the stock's 30-day volume weighted average price as of Wednesday's close.** The stock jumped 47% premarket. The deal is expected to close by the fourth quarter of 2022 and have already been unanimously approved by the SJI board. ""As energy markets across the U.S. and New Jersey accelerate the transition toward low carbon and renewable energy, the SJI Board determined that now is the opportune time to join forces with IIF,"" said Mike Renna, President and CEO, of SJI. The company will remain locally managed and headquartered in Folsom, New Jersey once the deal closes and Renna will continue in his role.

My question regards the section that is bolded. As the stock will be aquired by IIF at $36 per share, does that mean my stock will be liquidated at that price, or is that just the threshold at which IIF will purchase this company.

In other words, if the stock as valued at $36 per shared by IIF, should I consider purchasing additional shares before this take over date later in Q4?",stocks,1645725825

I feel like the stock market performance for these past 2 years during the pandemic was somewhat... _odd?_ With the increase of unemployment rates, decreased business in all sectors, etc. Yet many companies and industries managed to hit their all-time highs.

49,A Few Details About Stock Market Corrections/Crashes!,"1. They happen more than you think - pullbacks of 10% or more occurred 11our of the last 20 years

2. Of those, 4 out of 20 years (20%) had pull backs of at least 30% during their yearly lows 

3. While over half of the last 20 years have had double digit pullbacks, only 4 of those pullbacks ended the year negative. 

4. Bear markets (decline of at least 20%) on average last about 17 months 

5. On average, if you buy at the top before a bear market, it takes 4.4 years or (1,100 trading days) for you to make your initial investment back. 

Summary: 

If you have a time horizon of 5+ years the likelihood you lose money is near zero and if you have a time horizon of 20+years your likelihood of losing money is 0%.  Note this applies if investing in the broader market (i.e. S&amp;P/Nasdaq/maybe a few blue chips).  

DCA is king and can help shorten these timelines in your favor.

Or conversely, is anybody currently in a hedge plan that is not fully unfolded with positions they’ve yet to take. 

Just curious. I’ve learned a shit ton in 24 hours.

Plus inflation in US, UK and elsewhere and what looks like the start of a period of rate rises doing apparently being priced in. 

Nonetheless, although of course  the NASDAQ 100 is affected by three macro pressures, it’s down 18.3% YTD vs S&amp;P -11.9%; DJIA -9.4%. For these major indices, that 6.5-8.5% gap seems like a pretty wide spread over just a couple of months. 

Tech prices are going through a challenging period - seemingly disproportionately when compared with the significant difficulty the world markets are experiencing. My Vietnam investment trust has dropped a couple of percent; my Saudi ETF hasn’t changed much; my Nordic and European ETFs have tanked - but only relatively recently, which is clearly due to their being hugely impacted by the trouble in Ukraine; and even then, still not be as much as the NASDAQ. 

Does anyone have some insight on what might be happening here with NASDAQ and big tech, and why - and what we might be seeing in the short term? Beyond Meta crapping out - that I’m aware of and can understand :)

I agree this quote works in a normal world, but we are currently not in a normal world anymore.

There has not been a single good news for a while, there isn’t going to be any good news anytime soon. All the worst possible situations are happening one after the other. It all looks like a worldwide Murphy’s law.

19,Gold ETFs and Miners,"When I first joined r/stocks back in late January, there was heavy criticism for anyone who put their money in gold and silver.  Gold bugs were ""paranoid"", ""dumb"", ""boomer"" and so on.  That's when I decided to stop taking this sub seriously for as long as we're in a bear market.  Y'all might be great at picking stocks in bull markets, but when a major downturn happens, the tech stocks everyone love turn to trash.  Since Feb 1st, gold is up 8% while the S&amp;P is down 7% and the Nasdaq down 10% (and will be even more down at the open tomorrow).  Miners are doing even better.  Gold is going to go up as long as inflation is high and there is geopolitical instability.  Now, if you're able to let go of your pride and join the gold train, we'll be happy to have you.

[https://imgur.com/a/5cCfBSO](https://imgur.com/a/5cCfBSO)

The currency is in Swedish Kroners, and right now 1 sek is about 0.11 US. I have put translation of what the fields mean on the picture.

So you can see that I am down by around 97K USD at the moment (it has gone down by more than 30K just the last 2 days!). This is despite the the USD to SEK exchange rate that has helped me a bit because the SEK has fallen quite a lot compared to the USD the past few months.

Also, 106k USD of my porfolio is on margin.

This is really fucking up my mental health (not able to sleep properly for several weeks now, unable to focus on work, falling back to old addictions that I have thought I was done with like starting to smoke again after 10 years and even using escorts, etc..). I think I have to do something quick before this gets out of control. 

I am thinking of doing this: 

1) pay back the margin by selling some stocks and also putting in some cash in ASAP 

(I was margin called both Tuesday and Wednesday, which was really scary, first time experiencing that. I have quickly fixed it by putting around 15K of cash and selling some AMZN )

2a) Once I have nothing in margin, just let it ride the rest of the year or whatever, I don't have any immediate need for the cash

2b) Liquidate everything immediately as well and wait until there is some calm in the market (yes, I know, I may miss the bottom)

2c)Liquidate everything immediately, but once a week or so start putting a certain amount into VTI or something similar (e.g. assuming I don't go down crazy by open on Thursday, I will have around 250K, so let's say I start putting 25K per week on VTI)

I am more or less set on #1 (getting rid of the margin). But not sure about which of 2a, 2b or 2c makes more sense.

**Any recommendations?**

It is very hard to swallow such a big loss, which is equivalent to 23% (could be much more depending on what happens the next couple of days), but I am really struggling mentally at the moment and do not know how long I can sustain such stress.

*PS:  Around November,  my whole portfolio, which includes 3 other investment accounts and KRYPTOs, was worth almost 800k, and I was really thinking I could hit my target financial independence networth of 1.5M before 2025. I have not completely assessed the damage on the KRYPTOs yet, but if I have to estimate my whole networth is now probably between 500 to 550k.*",stocks,1645679870

29,My theory on tech stocks given Russia,"First and foremost I feel horrible for the people of Ukraine! I am hoping for a swift resolution to this and I’m praying this does not lead to significant or ideally any loss of life! 

When I look at the history we have seen sharp rebounds in the US stock markets within a few months of wars. In addition to that the markets were getting wrecked by the FEDs indecision on rate hikes. 

I know believe that because of the price instability, war in Russia, the belief that inflation is transitory (given oil prices are going to surge) , we will see the rate hikes be moderated to something the market may not have priced.

If they tighten to much which I think will be very hesitant to do so… they will further thank the market. Therefore long duration tech and growth may see a bounce in price. In fact I heard a few people on Bloomberg talk about buying profitable tech

Meanwhile, oil prices popped, with West Texas Intermediate futures trading 2.9% higher at $94.79 per barrel. Global benchmark Brent jumped 2.8% to $99.50 per barrel and briefly touched the $100 mark.

Those moves came as Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would launch a military action in Ukraine. Shortly after that announcement, NBC News reported that explosions were heard in Kyiv.

President Joe Biden condemned the attack, saying in a statement that “the world hold Russia accountable.”

“Russia alone is responsible for the death and destruction this attack will bring, and the United States and its Allies and partners will respond in a united and decisive way,” Biden said.

when this stock starts to move how I predict it will, is there a way to use comparisons of other stocks ratios to make a parallels for where I think the price can grow to? even though this is more in the speculative I'm just looking to understand when the stock momentum may start to die out relative to industry peers.

37,Dow futures drop 800 points after Russia announces military action against Ukraine,"U.S. stock futures fell sharply Wednesday evening as tensions between Russia and Ukraine boiled over.

Dow futures fell 660 points or 1.99%, while futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 were down 2.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures declined 2.56%.

The decline came as Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow would launch a military action in Ukraine. Shortly after that announcement, NBC News reported that explosions were heard in Kyiv.

In the regular trading session, the Dow dropped about 464 points, or 1.3%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.8%, moving deeper into correction and ending the day about 12% from its Jan. 3 record close. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite lost 2.6%.

Investors continued to assess the potential outcome of the situation in Ukraine and what it could mean for markets, as the country warned its citizens in Russia to leave. Meanwhile, the U.S. said it will impose additional sanctions against Russia, and the U.K. said it’s ready to do the same.

However, some are beginning to shrug off Ukraine-related anxieties, noting that it’s not alone in contributing to the current market pulldown and won’t be the cause of much, if any, longer-term damage.

“So far, it looks like Ukraine is not the reason for the drop, despite the fears,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network. “So, if that is the case, future damage to the markets from the Ukraine crisis, if any, should be limited.”

What’s more likely pulling markets down is higher interest rates, he added, and that nevertheless, it’s important to consider the indirect impacts the Ukraine crisis could have on the market. Specifically, it could keep inflation higher than it might have been otherwise.

“Market volatility is normal, but the truth is that the decline we have seen so far is much less than might have been expected,” McMillan said. “That is due to the strength of the fundamentals, which should continue.”

In earnings, several big companies are scheduled to report Thursday. Anheuser-Busch, Alibaba, Discovery and Moderna will report before the opening bell. Coinbase, Block, Dell, Etsy and Beyond Meat are up after the close.

On the economic data front, investors are looking ahead to GDP and jobless claims before the opening bell and new home sales figures later in the morning Thursday.

Dow futures tank 500 points on news,"The United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting Wednesday night as Russian President Vladimir Putin, in an early morning address local time, said he would launch a military operation in eastern Ukraine.

Earlier, European and U.S. officials scrambled to penalize Russia on Wednesday, responding to its deployments of troops to eastern Ukraine with a cascade of economic sanctions.

As concerns grew that Russian aggression would escalate, Ukraine warned its citizens to avoid traveling to Russia and to leave the country immediately if they are already there. The move came after Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday that Moscow is “always open” to diplomacy, days after ordering troops into eastern Ukraine and recognizing the independence of two self-declared republics in the region.

The European Union was set to hold an emergency emergency meeting on Thursday, and was reportedly considering another round of sanctions on Russian individuals. Officials from the United Kingdom and United States also announced or threatened more retaliatory measures after they unveiled initial tranches this week.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said in a public address that aired early Thursday morning in Moscow that he had authorized a military operation in Ukraine.

The announcement was broadcast shortly after 5:30 a.m. local time, precisely at the same time as the United Nations Security Council was meeting in New York, and member state representatives were openly pleading with Putin not to attack.",stocks,1645672470

58,Dennis Gartman’s 22 Rules of Trading.,"1. Never, under any circumstance add to a losing position.... ever! Nothing more need
be said; to do otherwise will eventually and absolutely lead to ruin!
2. Trade like a mercenary guerrilla. We must fight on the winning side and be willing to change sides readily when one side has gained the upper hand.
3. Capital comes in two varieties: Mental and that which is in your pocket or account. Of the two types of capital, the mental is the more important and expensive of the two. Holding to losing positions costs measurable sums of actual capital, but it costs immeasurable sums of mental capital.
4. The objective is not to buy low and sell high, but to buy high and to sell higher. We can never know what price is ""low."" Nor can we know what price is ""high."" Always remember that sugar once fell from $1.25/lb to 2 cent/lb and seemed ""cheap"" many times along the way.
5. In bull markets we can only be long or neutral, and in bear markets we can only be short or neutral. That may seem self-evident; it is not, and it is a lesson learned too late by far too many.
6. ""Markets can remain illogical longer than you or I can remain solvent,"" according to our good friend, Dr. A. Gary Shilling. Illogic often reigns and markets are enormously inefficient despite what the academics believe.
7. Sell markets that show the greatest weakness, and buy those that show the greatest strength. Metaphorically, when bearish, throw your rocks into the wettest paper sack, for they break most readily. In bull markets, we need to ride upon the strongest winds... they shall carry us higher than shall lesser ones.
8. Try to trade the first day of a gap, for gaps usually indicate violent new action. We have come to respect ""gaps"" in our nearly thirty years of watching markets; when they happen (especially in stocks) they are usually very important.
9. Trading runs in cycles: some good; most bad. Trade large and aggressively when trading well; trade small and modestly when trading poorly. In ""good times,"" even errors are profitable; in ""bad times"" even the most well researched trades go awry. This is the nature of trading; accept it.
10. To trade successfully, think like a fundamentalist; trade like a technician. It is imperative that we understand the fundamentals driving a trade, but also that we understand the market's technicals. When we do, then, and only then, can we or should we, trade.
   
         11. Respect ""outside reversals"" after extended bull or bear runs. Reversal days on the charts signal the final exhaustion of the bullish or bearish forces that drove the market previously. Respect them, and respect even more ""weekly"" and ""monthly,"" reversals.
12. Keepyourtechnicalsystemssimple.Complicatedsystemsbreedconfusion; simplicity breeds elegance.
13. Respect and embrace the very normal 50-62% retracements that take prices back to major trends. If a trade is missed, wait patiently for the market to retrace. Far more often than not, retracements happen... just as we are about to give up hope that they shall not.
14. An understanding of mass psychology is often more important than an understanding of economics. Markets are driven by human beings making human errors and also making super-human insights.
15. Establish initial positions on strength in bull markets and on weakness in bear markets. The first ""addition"" should also be added on strength as the market shows the trend to be working. Henceforth, subsequent additions are to be added on retracements.
16. Bear markets are more violent than are bull markets and so also are their retracements.
17. Be patient with winning trades; be enormously impatient with losing trades. Remember it is quite possible to make large sums trading/investing if we are ""right"" only 30% of the time, as long as our losses are small and our profits are large.
18. The market is the sum total of the wisdom ... and the ignorance...of all of those who deal in it; and we dare not argue with the market's wisdom. If we learn nothing more than this we've learned much indeed.
19. Do more of that which is working and less of that which is not: If a market is strong, buy more; if a market is weak, sell more. New highs are to be bought; new lows sold.
20. The hard trade is the right trade: If it is easy to sell, don't; and if it is easy to buy, don't. Do the trade that is hard to do and that which the crowd finds objectionable. Peter Steidelmeyer taught us this twenty-five years ago and it holds truer now than then.
21. There is never one cockroach! This is the ""winning"" new rule submitted by our friend, Tom Powell.
   
         22. All rules are meant to be broken: The trick is knowing when... and how infrequently this rule may be invoke",stocks,1645664089

92,"Skillz slides 29% after earnings miss, weaker 2022 guidance","Skillz (NYSE:SKLZ) is nose-diving after hours, 29% lower after its fourth-quarter earnings missed on top and bottom lines amid a wider loss.

Revenues grew 61% to $108.8 million, short of consensus for $114.1 million.

That was primarily driven by growth in paying monthly active users, it says, which grew by 56% to 0.61 million. Monthly average revenue per paying user rose 3% year-over-year, to $59.

""We achieved a lot, but we did not accomplish all the aggressive goals we had set for 2021,"" Skillz says - notably full-year revenue of $384.1 million that fell short of management guidance for $389 million.

Gross profit rose 56% to $100.4 million. But net loss widened to $99 million, from a prior-year loss of $67 million.

“Last year, we made substantial investments in our infrastructure necessary to build the competition layer of the Internet,” says CEO Andrew Paradise. “We are now entering a new phase, where we will shift focus to profitable growth through improving marketing efficiency, and deploying fewer but more impactful product features.”

It's initiating 2022 revenue guidance at $400 million, well short of consensus for $548.8 million. It's basing the estimate on an expected reduction in engagement marketing as a percentage of revenue of about 10 points, vs. the 49% or revenue in 2021.",stocks,1645654304

96,AAII investor sentiment - useful data point,"The American Association of Individual Investors conducts a weekly survey showing the moods of individual investors. It’s been around since 1987 and collects a lot of data.

When the bullish sentiment is at least 20% lower than the bearish sentiment, equities have been higher 6 months later 100% of the time. Yes 100% since 1987. The 2/16 survey found that 19.2% of investors were bullish and 43.2% of investors were bearish, or a 24% gap. 

How could this be? It’s because bearish investors are likely to sell, so when the overwhelming sentiment is bearish, stocks become oversold. Then good news can actually trigger a run. Investors also don’t get bearish until the market sells off.

31,Here's why I'm Bearish,"As a response to the other post I saw...

&amp;#x200B;

1. Rates / currency / repo markets have priced in 6.5 rate hikes, not EQUITY or other risk asset markets. If you survey them, they still think 4 or less... NONE think 6 or 7.
   1. In rate hiking cycles, the Fed has ALWAYS followed the rate markets (so unless something changes, expect 6-7 hikes this yr)
2. Economic data are strong BUT it's decelerating - that's what matters. MARKETS DON'T WANT RATE HIKES INTO GROWTH SLOWDOWN! Remember 4Q18? What matters is if growth is accelerating or decelerating, not whether growth is positive.
   1. Omicron data will make it look like Jan was good but the key months to look at will be Mar-May. If you look at 4Q earnings, 2022 guidance and EPS revisions have been weak! 4Q earnings vs. consensus have been weaker than historical average.
   2. Also unemployment figures are one of the most, if not the most, lagging indicator... So the danger is if the Fed is looking at unemployment figures (which is their bigger mandate) to see if they should stop hiking - they might only change their stance when it's too late.
3. Consumer looks strong on AVERAGE but a more detailed look is very worrisome... The gap between haves and have-nots are getting a lot worse..
   1. Consumer savings are up but very concentrated for the rich. The have-nots barely have any to go around (\~40% have &lt;$1,000)
   2. Wage inflation is more pronounced at higher paying jobs (look at [Atlanta Fed Wage Tracker](https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker) by wage level). REAL WAGE is FALLING for the have-nots. The have-nots are really hurting right now and everybody knows!
4. Inflationary pressures likely won't ease that much. China's zero COVID policy is a major reason but I'm not sure if anybody is really investing into more capacity closer to home (certainly not the case in autos and low end semis where we see massive shortages - but curious to hear if others have different data points). If COVID has led to a structural shift of demand to higher consumption of goods vs. pre-COVID levels due to more permanent WFH (I heard \~50% of US employees can WFH, and I know I certainly will WFH a significant amount of the time), the supply chain is NOT READY yet and will continue to have bottlenecks (for example, I heard shipbuilders don't have labor supply cuz of COVID )
   1. We also don't know if there will be future mutations that could throw the picture worse on inflation, like Omicron did
   2. My guess is inflation likely peaks in Feb (base effects work both ways) but will stay elevated this year
   3. Generally on supply chain... yes, it's improving, but it's still CRAZY backed up. From what I've heard, we've gone from 4.5 std dev over on supply chain bottlenecks to like 4 std dev over is improving, but its still 4 std dev higher.. Curious to hear if people with boots on the ground are hearing something different
5. Inflation is the key political issue (see point 3)! More important than COVID or Ukraine or whatever. Biden is saying Powell is going to address them (with rate hikes). It's mid-term elections in 2022... so it's important
6. Don't even get me started on valuations. I know your growth stocks are down 50-80% bust just look at S&amp;P valuations vs. historicals (it's not apples to apples but hard to say S&amp;P is cheap)

So put that together, I don't really see what the upside for S&amp;P / broader markets look like. I think you're not looking at some of these deep enough. So the main issue is **if inflation is &gt;3% in 2022 with massive growth slowdown and thus Fed wants to hike way more than equity markets are anticipating, can S&amp;P go up?** The Fed has said they want inflation to run hot to catch up to long run 2%, but guess what?

34,CROX FINALLY Hit Bottom - Here are 20 reasons I'm buying today and expecting big returns,"I Love Crocs and I love the stock. But the stock has taken a beating unfairly due to their recent acquisition, profit taking, and general market jitters for anything that has a supply chain. But the fact of the matter is, Crocs is an incredible company on a tear and it looks like the stock just hit bottom. Some facts to support my case:

1. CROX is down -54% from its all time high
2. Trading at a P/E of 8, making it a value stock unfairly grouped into the growth-stock-garbage bucket. It's nearest peer/competitor, Decker's, trades at a P/E of 20 and has 1/4 of the revenue growth (10% for DECK)
3. Revenue growth = 43% q/q and 67% TTM
4. Projected earnings growth is 23% for 2022
5. EBIT margin is high at 31%
6. Trading at 9x free cash flow
7. Will benefit from people going back to stores
8. Brand is incredibly recognizable and beloved. I've tried finding replacements, but it's not worth the hassle when they just work
9. Company continues to invent new types of footwear, from slippers and boots sold for winter to women's sandals that aren't ugly
10. It's a favorite shoe of parents. Kids can pee on them, puke on them, drop ice cream on them and they clean up fast in a sink. And unlike sneakers it doesn't take 20mins to put them on kids
11. Refinitiv just upgraded the stock to a buy as did Zacks. 
12. Most recent analyst upgrade sets the price at $200 (if you pay attention or care about analyst opinions - I don't but it does give some signs of potential momentum building). It's trading at 81/share. 
13. TA shows a double bottom at $79
14. Insiders just started buying the stock
15. CEO guidance was very strong for 2022 and beyond, forecasting revenue growth of 300% by 2026
16. They still have 1B set aside for stock buybacks in 2022. 
17. They are in position to capitalize on the coming post-covid revenge travel and spring/summer weather
18. Their acquisition of Hey Dude will add over 600m in annual revenue at 31% profit and increase their online DTC channels, which were already up 64% yoy. This will enable them to keep their margins high due to not having to pay for the middle man. They paid 2B in cash for the deal but financed the entire thing at today's low interest rates so they have retained their own cash for expansion/buybacks.
19. Market cap is currently just under 5B at a price to sales ratio of 2. Even at that reasonable valuation, if they hit the 6B in sales by 2026 they project, they would be worth 12B. I think it's more likely they will be trading much higher than that. 
20. As the supply chain issues dissolve and shipping costs go down in H2 2022, they will see profit margin expansion.",stocks,1645637917

40,Why I'm Bearish," 

1. Interest rates r not priced in as no one knows what they will be. Additionally, analysts base their goofy PTs off the 10 year, which will change, which will cause analysts to slash said PTs.
2. GDP is whateverish and unemployment is extremely contaminated data.
3. No one has any idea what inflation is at. If you use the old metrics it would show us at around 16%. The amount of money this country printed and gave away is unreal. Wages cannot match.
4. If Russia invades, it will affect gas, neon, palladium, etc. n screw everyone.
5. Supply chain is a little better, but we are months if not a year or two away from getting back. People do not want to work and wages are an issue...a major one.
6. Deaths are still high with Covid. Winter is ending and you are probably right, but herd immunity with this sort of virus is not permanent...short-lived in fact. Additionally it could mutate and we all could die.

52,Lemonade ($LMND) - is it really worth just 500m?,"Like many other high growth ""tech"" stocks this one has tumbled a lot in the past months. It's now valued at just 1.5bn, and they have a cash pile of 1 billion. Now granted, they are also unprofitable and burning cash, but at a rate of 94m in the past 9 months, they still have a decent runway ahead of them. 

It seems this company is pretty controversial, for a while it was heralded as a great new insurance company with fancy technology, while others are saying all they have are glorified chatbots. I do think their success isn't certain, but they continue to grow customers and premium at a fast rate (45% and 84% y-o-y respectively). They also seem to attract a very young customer base that typically isn't too keen on insurance products. If the customers end up growing with the company, it could pay off for them in the long run. Do you think the company is attractive at this price, or do they still have room to drop?",stocks,1645632394
53,Algos and Futures trading,"We know that machine learning is just not there, yet.     Isn't it possible that algos are making huge mistakes with how they are valuing companies, especially ""future"" companies?     I'm sure there are easy ways for machine learning to look at sales to debt, etc.,   but does it take into account , for instance:   CEO's past success,  a nascent industry that the company is entering,  popularity amongst customers ,  number of competitors, etc. etc. etc.   There are tons of them, those are just a couple I was thinking of that may or may not apply. 

In any case,  my point is this:  Perhaps the algos are pushing down a bunch of companies that really have what appears to be a bright future to many traders that are looking at these companies from a different perspective.  You can talk about numbers all you want,  but some of the greatest companies of all time have had really bad debt, etc. ,  and that is to be expected from a company trying to grow .   

Perhaps we're in the midst of a true buying opportunity here,  unlike anything we've seen before.    Perhaps these algos that are controlling a lot of the trading these days, are not quite there yet and are missing some big pieces of the puzzle.

But the future 5 or so years of home demand is what matters. Heres a list of things I think are important. If you know the industry and any specific ones like DHI, MHO, let me know what else I should be considering.

-lumber supply and prices

-location of home being built (south like texas area is booming while north not really)

-the company focus. Starter tract homes in higher demand than luxury

-usage of land options vs pre purchasing gives less debt liability makes the company more lean and flexible

-valuing based on fcf is pointless (unless you seperate maint cap) because most of capex is building new homes and inventory, using earnings growth and book value/equity is better

-its a cyclical business, currently the housing market has short supply and high demand

-interest rates hikes cut down mortgage approvals which is a downward pressure, though may be compensated by such short supply

-labour shortage currently is a downward pressure

What else might be a consideration to factor in currently or future looking?",stocks,1645623494

88,In-depth analysis: Maybe Putin already got what he wanted?,"Although it’s kind of an international political issue, it’s freaking the market out for the past few weeks. I’d like to offer some ‘good case scenario’ analysis.

So first of all, a large scale invasion won’t happen. If it does, the sanctions on Russia will be crippling. The trade with Europe will be affected and many American companies have vital interest in them and in the broad European economy. I doubt if anyone wants that to happen at all.

Second of all, let’s examine the motive of Putin. What does he want? He knows Ukraine is drifting away and at this point it’s pretty much irreversible. But to safeguard the border, he would have to have some ‘buffer zone’. Therefore he orchestrated the ‘independence’ of these two regions, placing the military around Ukraine as a threat to make sure Ukraine does not respond fiercely. Now that he got the buffer zone he wanted, it’s doubtful that he is willing to escalate this. Since Ukraine is not In NATO, the NATO will basically just be training and supplying some weapons. It’s very unlikely that they will venture an incursion into the Donbas region.

Now finally, what does the US want? Why the US is acting like a maniac, almost unilaterally declaring that Russia is going to invade Ukraine like ghengis khan leading his steeds and cover the country with blood? Why it’s denying any possibility of accepting some of Putin’s demands as if wanting there to be major conflict? First of all, US wants an unstable and weak Russia. Making the situation bigger will allow the US to come up with more severe sanctions. It can also shake up the ties between European countries and Russia, ensuring that the US’s dominance will persist (if we ignore China for a second). There is absolutely no way that the US is going to put boots on the ground. But the weapon companies are very happy to sell more weapons, either to the pentagon to donate them or to Eastern European countries who feel threatened by the move. So weaker opponent and profit on the fears, why not?

My guess is that this is Putin’s multi-year (or even decade) plan to encroach the eastern Ukraine, possibly up to Kyiv. This step will be just like the 2014 Crimea crisis, put a little dent in the market and then it’s effects will fizzle out.

(That is not to say any interest rate hike or balance sheet reduction won’t affect the market. That
 is definitely the major uncertainty the FUD we see is leeching onto. I’m not sure how that will play out.)",stocks,1645604850

$U (Unity Software, Inc.) - 3D game creation and modelling company. AR, VR, mobile games. Recently acquired Weta and Ziva for sophisticated 3D character simulation. Digital twin potential for industry, architecture, shopping, sports, metaverse. Explosive sales growth. Not yet profitable.

$MTTR (Matterport, Inc.) - Spatial data company focused on digitizing and indexing the built world. Stock down an astonishing -80% in three months. I have never owned the stock, but down here with a market cap under $2B it intrigues. Big miss last earnings call.

$CGNX (Cognex Corporation) - Machine vision products that automate manufacturing and distribution tasks where vision is required. These will be the components that make use of and operate within the digital twin environment. Has earnings. Chart leaves much to be desired.

$FANUY (Fanuc Corporation) - Japanese company providing a wide array of automation products.

13,"Biotech -- Inflection point, or more pain?","Hi all, wondering what you guys think of biotech. In this post, I will specifically be referring to $xbi.

Biotech as an industry is incredibly hated right now, small and large caps alike. While I appreciate the fact that the current macro environment is less than favourable to say the least, there are some things pointing towards the possibility that a bottom is being approached. 

\- largest underperformance relative to SPY since inception

\- Its looking increasingly possible that the index is about to have two consecutive red years for the first time since inception.

\- valuations at all time lows, yet big pharma has record amounts of cash on hand. M&amp;A could be a driving factor this year. 

\- XBI currently is sitting at a 55% short interest, compared to 7% for SPY. \*IF\* sentiment changes, the unwind will be violent.

14,Why I’m bullish,"With all of the bearish sentiment around here, I’d like to give a reason as to why I’m bullish through the rest of 2022.

1. Interest rate hikes have been priced in at this point. Unless the Fed does something totally unhinged, the market should respond positively when the hikes start being implemented.

2. Economic data is strong. Consumer spending, GDP growth, unemployment numbers, etc. Periods of high inflation aren’t necessarily indicative of economic issues. GDP contraction and unemployment are much better indicators.

3. Inflation seems to have peaked or is currently peaking, so we should start getting better inflation numbers going forward as interest rates move up.

4. Russia/Ukraine is a temporary situation. WW3 is not going to happen. I’m not staying that Russia isn’t going to invade, but it doesn’t pose any long term risks to the US economy.

5. Supply chain issues will ease, as many companies have guided this, and as someone who works in logistics I can tell you that the disruptions are easing.

6. Covid is dying down and is exiting the pandemic phase. This is very overlooked for some reason.

While there are some risks present, and I expect a choppy market over the coming weeks, I think we make new highs by the end of 2022. That’s my call, and would love to hear arguments against it.",stocks,1645576100

31,2 Growth Stocks for March: Palantir (PLTR) and Sonos (SONO),"As the next payslip comes closer, I've been looking at new growth stocks to add to my portfolio. These two stocks are currently trading at a good price and they also have a good chance of growing a lot over the next 3 years.

# Palantir (PLTR)

First of all, we have Palantir trading under PLTR. If you haven't heard of Palantir, well, they had their IPO in September 2020. Palantir are a data company that provides a number of products like Foundry, Gotham and Apollo which they sell to government and enterprise clients. The actual details of what those products too are very, very complicated, but in simple terms, they provide data integration. These products help users deal with and process unstructured data which is a really big problem in the IT space right now. In fact, roughly 80 to 90% of all data in the world is unstructured and Palantir is one of the few companies that allows users to tap into that unstructured data. This is really what makes Palantir unique. There are not a lot of companies that do what Palantir does. In fact, there's probably less than 10.

Palantir is still in the early stages of growth and is expected to grow in revenue by about 24% annually while their earnings is expected to grow by 77% annually. Still, Palantir is currently unprofitable and they have lost $520 million US dollars in the last 12 months.  They are currently not expected to make a profit until 2024 so at least 2 years from now. However, they have no debt and cash equivalents of about $2.52 billion US dollars meaning that they can continue to run for at least 5 years before they run out of cash so their financial situation is looking solid. 

The one problem that I personally see with Palantir is **their massive operating expenses**. Currently, they are incurring more operating expenses than the revenue that they are generating. They have $1.61 billion US dollars in operating expenses with only a $1.54 billion US dollars in revenue which is really concerning. However, as I said, Palantir is in a very early stage of growth and I'm hoping that they will resolve this soon. Right now, what's important for Palantir is to get more customers, more big contracts and that's really what they have been focusing on. Last quarter, Palantir added 15 net new customers worth between $1 and $10 million US dollars and 19 net customers worth $10 million or more. 

Plus, Palantir is currently trading at its cheapest since the IPO! The average analyst price target is $16.28 on a current price of $10.48 which gives us about 53.4% upside. A simple discounted cash flow model also gives us a valuation of $15.33 which is an upside of 46.3%. Personally, I think we can see much, much higher prices for Palantir, but my main point here is that at a price of $10.5 dollars, Palantir is CHEAP and can give you a decent profit. 

# Sonos (SONO)

Then, we have Sonos trading under SONO. Sonos is a company that design, develops and manufactures multi-room audio products around the world. Chances are you or somebody you know has Sonos products in their living room or bedroom. 2021 was a good year for Sonos as they reported their best results yet. The company isn't massive with a market cap of $3.4 billion US dollars, $1.7 billion dollars of revenue and $149 million dollars in earnings, but it is finally starting to see a consistent growth in both revenue and earnings. Analysts are expecting 23.2% annual earnings growth and 11.3% annual revenue growth, both of which are above the industry average and the US average. The Sonos management actually expects a revenue growth of between 14 and 16% for 2022 along with earnings growth of only 14.9% to 16.2% so hopefully they will gives us some pleasant news. In terms of finances, Sonos has no debt and has a cash equivalents pile of $754 million US dollars, basically meaning that its enterprise value only $2.7 billion dollars. An enterprise value that is lower than the company's market cap is always a good. Also, given that Sonos also has a PE ratio of 22.9 which is slightly lower than its historical average and also a PEG ratio of 1, the company is looking really cheap right now.

Analysts are also revising their revenue expectations for Sonos in 2022 with 7 revisions up and 0 down, but it looks like they are mixed when it comes to earnings with 2 revisions up and 2 revisions down. Still, the fact that they are unanimously raising revenue expectations is a good sign. Plus, Sonos seems like an all-round good business. Good value, good financials. The management also seems to be doing well in terms of effectiveness because Sonos has a 22% Return on Equity compared to the industry average of 19% and a Return of Assets of 10.9% compared to the industry average of 9.7%. That's really good to see because it means that Sonos is capable of putting their money to good use which is what every investor wants to see. Return on Equity and Return on Assets are two of Warren Buffet's favourite metrics so it's good to see that Sonos is doing well there.

Now, the only problem I can see with Sonos is optimistic analyst expectations. There is a chance that Sonos' growth will slow down because of supply chain issue around semiconductors. In fact, we have already seen that although the impact wasn't too bad. Still, it could get worse. Plus, sales could slow down as people finally start spending more on holidays, vacations and so on. Apart from that, Sonos is looking like a really solid pick in book. The average target price is also relatively high with an average estimate of $41.43 dollars on the current price of $26.53 so that's a potentially big upside of 56.2%. My discounted cash flow valuation also gives Sonos a fair value of $87.87 dollars which is really high and an upside of 231%. I'm not sure if we will see prices like that in the next year or two, but it does show that Sonos is likely to give us some profits if we buy it at this point.

34,WHY the world needs Electric Vehicles BADLY in light of the Ukraine-Russia Crisis and super high inflation!," [Thankyou for opening your Tesla Folder 📁](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/)

What the hell is going on?

Russia is invading Ukraine, Oil prices have reached $5 a gallon, inflation is at 40-year highs and it seems like the world is getting scarier and scarier everyday…

# Now more than ever YOU NEED to own a Tesla or Electric Vehicle ….. but why?

In this article I talk about the current insane volatility and dooms-day scenario we find ourselves in and specifically how Tesla and electric vehicles can not only save the planet, save your life but also save you lots of money.

It has never been more important to own an Electric Vehicle than it is now, so here is EXACTLY HOW this information ties to your stock portfolio…..

# The Increasing NEED to own an EV⚠

The market in 2022 is absolutely crazy, inflation has reached the highest levels since 40+ years ago. Meanwhile you might have gotten a 5% raise, woo-hoo, oh. Wait. Because inflation is so f\*cking high you’re purchasing power STILL decreased year over year! How crazy is that? The recent macro currents have not been this unpredictable in a very long time, with both the Federal Reserve tightening and potentially WW3 breaking out with the Russian potential invasion of Ukraine.

Because of all this, it is simple. You need an EV. You' need an EV, because it will drastically reduce the amount of money you’re spending on fuelling up your car and getting it serviced. Tesla recently released an amazing feature that highlights the money Tesla owners are saving by not-having to buy gas for their cars. It’s quite staggering.

In one example a Tesla user saved nearly $300 per month, *$300!* Do you not see how crazy that is? With recent gas prices reaching nearly $5 a gallon, it is becoming unjustifiable to purchase an Internal Combustion Engine vehicle as opposed to an EV.

It is a fact that a Tesla will save you money on fuel costs, maintenance, and depreciation. Buying an EV will save the average driver alot of money on running costs. Oh, and not to mention Tesla’s appreciate? Although this is likely not to last, Tesla cars are now selling for MORE than people bought them for a few years ago.

The worlds current dependency on gas and oil is not only disgustingly harmful for the environment, killing it in the process, but it is also becoming more and more economically costly for us to be this dependent on them, this dependency was and is being exploited by Russia and is putting the world on the edge of war, because..

# A World at War highlighting the importance of EV’s ✏

The current crisis in Ukraine and the fact that Russia is using their supply of Natural gas and Oil as a bargaining chip at the political table is costing thousands of people their lives and highlighting the need for the world to transition to sustainable energy NOW, not tomorrow not 2030 but NOW.

Popular Stock market investor Ross Gerber summarized it strongly;

&gt;“Gas is $5.50 (!!!!) a gallon in Los Angeles. The best incentive EVER to buy an EV and never go to a gas station again! Save yourself from inflation and supporting the Russian invasion. Say NO to OIL.”

A short but powerful and truthful statement. Currently Russia is preparing an invasion of Ukraine and the European Union is struggling to provide meaningful sanctions because majority of its member-states are dependent on Russian Natural gas and Oil in someway.

&amp;#x200B;

This hesitation to react to the clear violation of a countries borders is further reinforced by the current inflationary fears. Every person who owns a car that ISN’T an Electric Vehicle is suffering severely at the hands of unprecedented increasing gas and oil prices.

Currently about 2.3 million barrels of Russian crude ($75 billion a year at current spot prices) heads west each day through a network of pipelines to export terminals on the Baltic and Black Seas, as well as pouring directly into refineries in central and eastern Europe.

This issue is universal and is robbing you of YOUR money.

&amp;#x200B;

This isn’t just a European issue, as Ross Gerber mentioned, The United States is also feeling the impact of rising gas prices. The change to sustainable energy driven (literally) by electric vehicles is now more-than-ever an important step we must take to make our economies more resilient to political turmoil and the rash action of dictators.

By increasing our Sustainable energy sources we will be able to supply the grid with clean energy whilst decreasing overall costs and stabilizing prices. You will NEVER have to pay insane amounts of money to power your vehicle, to power your daily commute to work. As battery technology develops and EV’s become widespread, this will become the new reality, it is only a matter of when this happens. But not only does owning an EV save you money, it could save your life…..

# Being in a Tesla could save your life ⚡

The current European energy crisis could last years with natural gas stockpiles running lower and lower every day the recent storms hitting the United Kingdom and North-West Europe highlights the dangers of our current energy dependency.

Europe remains at the mercy of Putin and the Weather. Not only will switching to Electric Vehicles decrease this dependency, but Tesla’s are so well built *a Tesla could literally save your life.* With the recent storms creating BILLIONS in damage, some people unfortunately died when trees landed on their cars.

A Tree Fell on Tesla owner Sam Fursey’s car when they where driving, but luckily no-one was injured.

&gt;“ An old tree fell directly on my car, right above the driver's seat.  
I was driving my best friend and his fiancé to their wedding. We all walked away... **thank you higher powers, and Tesla engineers.**

With Tesla’s safety-first design, the Model 3 was able to become “**The safest car ever tested”** by the American National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The Model 3 literally had the lowest probability of injury in a crash compared to over 900 other vehicles tested. **42,060 people.**

42,060 people died on American roads in 2020. You NEVER know if this could be you, your loved one or one of your friends. Whether it is a tree falling on your car or a drunk driver t-boning your vehicle, you want to have the safest vehicles. Electric Vehicles in general are able to be safer than ICE vehicles due to the battery lowering the centre of gravity of the vehicle and allowing designers (like Tesla) to create significantly stronger castings that will better support the safety of the driver and passengers.

Not only has Tesla driven this safety revolution, [but they are also DOMINATING the Electric Vehicle](https://theteslafolder.substack.com/p/how-our-need-for-teslas-has-never?utm_source=url) market, and the stock price is about to go crazy when Tesla becomes the MOST PROFITABLE Automaker in the world in the year……

# Tesla’s EV dominance, and the future of the Stock Price 📈

Tesla currently comfortably sits as the biggest manufacturer of Electric Vehicles with a market share of 21% meaning that more than 1 in every 5 EV’s sold in the world was a Tesla car. Not only this, but Tesla has profit margins close to 30% whilst the average manufacturer sits at only 7%… Tesla is thus on the perfect path to dominating the world market by selling the MOST Electric Vehicles and also the MOST profitable vehicles. Reminder…..

Tesla is set to become a Trillion dollar company (again) very soon, potentially adding over $200 billion to its current market valuation.

But more importantly, let me tell **you** about Tesla’s DOMINANCE and how **you** should be reacting to the stock market’s recent HUGE violations and specifically how to make or lose money right….

# How to make (or lose) money right now 💸

Breathe. Breathe. Stop panicking. There are so many catalysts for Tesla stock in the coming year(s) it is actually unbelievable. Tesla trading around $800 means it is trading at only 8 X 2022 Revenue! It currently looks incredibly cheap when you keep in mind some short term and long term catalysts.

Whenever you see volatility like this in the market, look at the companies you own and look at HOW they’re performing. The current volatility in the year 2022 likely is irrelevant in 2030 when Tesla is producing potentially around 20 million cars per year. So always ALWAYS keep a long-term horizon.

But for everyone panicking in the short term, *SHOULD I SELL MY TESLA STOCK? or should I buy more? What DO I DO?!!*

I can’t answer that for you, but let me put it this way. Here are the current Short-term Tesla catalysts to keep in mind that:

📈Giga-Texas factory opening soon (Phase 1 capacity of 500,000 vehicles per year)

🏭Giga-Berlin factory opening soon (Phase 1 capacity of 500,000+ vehicles per year) This factory also reduces import costs, thus increasing already high profit margins

🚗Model S and X are ramping production (high margin luxury cars)

🔋 4680 Next-Generation battery cells are ramping production

and so much more, so to ensure you DON’T lose money during this volatile market keep a long term investment horizon. To stay-up to date with all ALL TESLA news feel free to subscribe to my newsletter in which I provide in-depth analysis you will not find anywhere else!

70,"Information on Geopolitics, Geology, O&amp;G and Russia/Ukraine.","  Hi all,

Thought I would do a write up for you. I have noticed quite a bit of inaccurate information on this sub-reddit regarding oil and gas. I have a background that is pretty specialized. Non-renewable commodities focused economics background, alongside an international relations, and geology background.

**First things first, some petroleum engineering/geology**: Natural gas is considered a byproduct of petroleum. Meaning they are often found together, however most of this will be oil.

If you look at the U.S. crude oil, and natural gas production graphs found here [https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/production/#oil-tab](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/production/#oil-tab) you will notice that they look incredibly similar.

You cannot transport oil and natural gas in the same pipeline. They require two different pipelines.

The cost to produce a barrel of oil largely depends on the geology of the area, in addition to the business environment. If you google “most oil reserves by country” you will notice something odd. Venezuela has the more reserves than most other countries, but produces next to none. That’s because the geology is bad, and their break even price is around $120. [https://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-loves-a-discount-but-wheres-the-support-for-oil-prices-2014-11](https://www.businessinsider.com/everyone-loves-a-discount-but-wheres-the-support-for-oil-prices-2014-11) 

We will see an increase in the price of oil and gas, but this also presents new opportunities for countries with high break-even prices. An example of this could be Canada, who needed a WTI price between $85 to $95 in order to break even according to IHS Markit in 2016. [https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/production-cost-and-the-canadian-oil-sands-in-a-lower-price-environment.html](https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/production-cost-and-the-canadian-oil-sands-in-a-lower-price-environment.html) 

Break even price readings:

[https://knoema.com/infographics/vyronoe/cost-of-oil-production-by-country](https://knoema.com/infographics/vyronoe/cost-of-oil-production-by-country) 

**So these companies will just produce more, right?**

First off, let me say that the idea we are “running out of oil” is incorrect, and inherently flawed. We typically discover more oil than we consume every year. From 1991-2011 the global consumption of oil grew by 32%, but the reserves (economically viable to extract) increased by 60%. [https://www.worldenergy.org/assets/images/imported/2013/10/WER\_2013\_2\_Oil.pdf](https://www.worldenergy.org/assets/images/imported/2013/10/WER_2013_2_Oil.pdf) 

COVID-19 put a pause on the exploration of oil and gas. This could be a **serious** problem. Oil reserves flat lined and have remained relatively the same in recent years. For smaller O&amp;G producers, they may not want to produce more oil until they get more reserves. If their reserves are not growing at a higher rate than their production, eventually they will be out of business.

In simple terms: Imagine you are living off of a savings or investment account. You spend 50k a year, but you gain 60k from interest/investing every year. Eventually you can start to spend more. But there is a multi year stretch where you are still spending 50k a year, but you are only gaining 40k in income. You know this is not sustainable in the long term. You either a) have to spend less, or b) have to get more interest/gains from investing. You cannot continue down this path. There are some oil &amp; gas companies in this situation.

**Russia/Ukraine and Pipelines:**

[https://mondediplo.com/maps/gas-pipelines](https://mondediplo.com/maps/gas-pipelines) 

[https://www.nationalgeographic.org/photo/europe-map/](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/photo/europe-map/) 

Most of the pipeline and LNG carriers in the area run through Ukraine. Logically, if war breaks out, Ukraine will not continue to allow Russia to transport on pipelines going through their country. This leaves only the pipelines so the north that run through Belarus, Poland, etc. But they do not have the capacity to supply the rest of the E.U.. The E.U. will likely sanction Russia, and refuse to buy their oil and gas. Ukraine does produce a fair bit of natural gas, but if there is a war, it is highly unlikely they will be worried about producing this for export to other countries.

The transport time to get oil and gas from other countries to the European Union could be a few weeks or more. The Persian Gulf area is close by, but this requires going through the Suez Canal, which can only take the 2nd largest tanker. There is about 571 of them globally. It can be done, but it will be a challenge to quickly meet their supply.

One topic that is not being discussed in here is the North Sea oil producers. Norway has a substantial oil industry, and can quickly supply the U.K., Germany, France, etc. It could be very likely that the EU tries to encourage companies in this area to ramp up production, to alleviate their pain. This can be achieved easiest since Norway has a state-run oil company.

**TLDR:**

Oil and gas production and prices will go up. Chance to see producers in countries with bad geology make record profits. Russia likely sanctioned, and Russia to Ukraine to Europe pipelines likely will be shut off. Potential for North Sea/Norwegian oil companies begin to produce lots more oil, as it is the closet location, and can quickly alleviate supply shocks compared to shipping from Middle East or USA.",stocks,1645549742

A “flash” index of service-oriented companies jumped to 57.5 this month from an 18-month low of 51.1 in the first month of 2022, IHS Markit said. A similar gauge of manufacturers rose to 52.5 in February from 50.5.

The flash IHS surveys offer the first broad look at the performance of the U.S. economy in each month. Any reading above 50 means businesses are growing and numbers above 55% are quite healthy.

**Big picture:** The economy suffered a blow as omicron exploded across the country, but the virus is receding now and governments are dropping restrictions on business such as vaccine mandates. That’s giving a lift to the economy.

Persistent labor and supply shortages remain a drag on the economy, however, and they are adding to the worst bout of U.S. inflation in 40 years. Some executives say the problems eased slight in February, but they are still a big problem.

**Looking ahead:** “The pace of economic growth accelerated sharply in February as virus containment measures, tightened to fight the omicron wave, were scaled back,” said Chris Williamson, chief business economist at IHS Markit. “Demand was reported to have revived and supply constraints, both in terms of component availability and staff shortages, moderated.”

Several companies that I consider the bedrock of my portfolio are currently at pretty attractive prices. The biggest name on this list is Target, as I feel the stock price has been irrationally punished for such an amazingly strong company which trades at a notable discount to its peers. I would also include CVS, BRK and JPM in this bucket although they are not trading anywhere near the discount TGT is with both CVS and BRK fairly close to ATH (still rock solid companies in a shaky environment which continually post very solid numbers). I also would include Enphase here because of their continuously outstanding financials and strong projections.

On the more speculative side of my portfolio I would put my small cap and growth ETFs such as qqqj and scha as well as clean energy like ICLN and TAN (enphase is the standout star, I find the rest more speculative).

# [Dow futures down slightly after erasing earlier losses amid Russia-Ukraine tensions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell slightly Tuesday morning, reversing much sharper declines earlier, as traders monitor brewing tensions between Russia and Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down by 60 points or 0.17%. S&amp;P 500 futures were off just 0.05%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slipped by 0.5%. The U.S. stock market was closed Monday due to the President’s Day holiday.
*****
&gt; All of the declines were well off their overnight lows that saw Dow futures down more than 500 points.
*****
&gt; Oil prices rose, with West Texas Intermediate futures jumping 4.5% to $95.19 per barrel.
*****
&gt; Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he would recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine, potentially undercutting peace talks with President Joe Biden. That announcement was followed by news that Biden was set to order sanctions on separatist regions of Ukraine, with the European Union vowing to take additional measures.
*****
&gt; Putin later ordered forces into the two breakaway regions.
*****
&gt; U.K. Health Minister Sajid Javid said Tuesday that “the invasion of Ukraine has begun.” U.S. President Joe Biden has not yet used the word “invasion” to describe the current activity. The nation has also started targeted economic sanctions against five Russian banks and three wealthy individuals.
*****
&gt; The news came after the White House said Sunday that Biden has accepted “in principle” to meet with Putin in yet another effort to deescalate the Russia-Ukraine situation via diplomacy. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the summit between the two leaders would occur after a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov.
*****
&gt; The Russia-Ukraine conflict has put pressure on market sentiment recently, with the major averages posting back-to-back weekly losses. The Dow fell 1.9% last week, and the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 1.6% and 1.8%, respectively.
*****
&gt; “While Monday’s episode will have important implications for Russia’s political relations with foreign partners, a significant market event is likely avoided for the time being, but the trajectory in the coming weeks will be important to monitor from a rising market risk perspective,” said Ed Mills of Raymond James.
*****
&gt; In early earnings action, Home Depot reported quarterly profit of $3.21 a share, three cents better than estimates, and said it sees earnings and revenue growth this year. Shares rose 1.4% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; Macy’s popped more than 7% in premarket trading after beating on the top and bottom lines of its quarterly results. Macy’s also authorized a new $2 billion share buyback program and announced a 5% dividend increase
*****
&gt; In deal news, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt shares surged 14.4% after the company said it would be taken private by Veritas Capital in a deal worth $21 a share, representing a nearly 16% premium from Friday’s close. The deal is expected to be completed in the second quarter.
*****
&gt; Traders are also keeping an eye on the Federal Reserve, as the U.S. central bank is expected to raise rates multiple times starting next month. Traders are betting that there is a 100% chance of a Fed rate hike after the March 15-16 meeting, with expectations tilting toward a 0.25 percentage point move, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.
*****
&gt; Expectations of tighter monetary policy have put pressure on stocks, particularly those in rate-sensitive sectors like tech, and have sent Treasury yield sharply higher to start 2022. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield ended last week around 1.93% after briefly breaking above 2%. The 10-year began 2022 trading at around 1.51%.
*****
&gt; “All eyes are on the Fed,” Strategas investment strategist Ryan Grabinski wrote in a note released Friday evening. “As of today, the market is expecting the Fed to raise interest rates at nearly every meeting this year. Despite that, we left Monetary Policy as Favorable for now because the Fed is continuing to purchase Treasuries (an accommodative policy action).”
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, Wall Street is preparing for the tail-end of the corporate earnings season, with Home Depot and eBay among the companies set to report this week. It has been a solid earnings season thus far: Of the more than 400 S&amp;P 500 companies that have posted fourth-quarter earnings, 77.7% have beaten analyst expectations, according to FactSet.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

38,A History of Bill Ackman's Best Defensive Hedge Trades," Hedging is a risk management strategy employed to offset losses by taking an opposite position in a related asset. Typically, hedging strategies will employ some form of derivative financial instruments, such as options or futures contracts. During turbulent times in the market such as the one we are in today, hedging can be one of the best ways to protect your portfolio.

Effective hedging, however, is not easy. Hedging does reduce downside exposure, but it also comes at the risk of limiting upside potential. There is also an inherent risk in hedging for investors who don’t understand the financial instruments involved in the process.

So to get a better understanding of how to effectively hedge downside risk, we decided to do a deep dive into Pershing Square’s track record with defensive hedging. Over the years, Ackman’s hedge fund has made some incredibly successful and lucrative downside bets that have increased investor returns. We wanted to get an idea of Ackman’s hedging strategy, as well as the financial instruments he utilized in each of them.

Hedging Bet #1

*Time Period: 2005 - 2009 (CDS Hedge)*

*Investment Cost: $64 million*

*Total Proceeds: $1.2 billion*

*Multiple of Capital (MOC): 18.5x*

*Financial Instrument Used: CDS on Bond Issuers (mostly MBIA)*

In 2002, Bill Ackman published a report underlining his short thesis on Municipal Bond insurer MBIA. The report, which was titled “[Is MBIA Triple A?](http://www.briem.com/files/Ackman_MBIA_12092002.pdf)”, provided details on the enormous leverage that was hidden inside MBIA and its subsidiary MBIA Insurance Corp.

Ackman’s short thesis was based on the following factors:

* Municipal Bond Insurance is not a lucrative business model, given that muni-bonds generally have guarantees from the state. Even then, insurance is generally used to lower the interest rate on these bonds. As a result, these insurance premiums were eating into the public money
* MBIA’s accounting was fraudulent and didn’t reflect the risk factors, particularly tied to leverage
* The structured finance products of MBIA were suspect. MBIA aimed to guarantee AAA-rated CDOs, but Wall Street and MBIA was manufacturing these ratings
* The loss of AAA rating would significantly impact MBIA’s ability to remain solvent

Not surprisingly, the report was met with resistance and doubts from all over Wall Street. Before the report was even published, MBIA’s Chairman and CEO Joseph Brown privately met with Ackman. This is what he had to say:

&gt;“You’re a young guy, early in your career. You should think long and hard before issuing the report. We are the largest guarantor of New York state and New York City bonds. In fact, we’re the largest guarantor of municipal debt in the country. Let’s put it this way: We have friends in high places.”

Ackman didn’t step down. He hired a top forensic accounting expert and brought evidence of MBIA’s fraudulent accounting several times to Moody’s. In 2005, Ackman wrote a letter to Moody’s Board of Directors which read:

&gt;“Moody’s AAA rating is so powerful and credible that investors don’t do any due diligence on the underlying credit. Every day that Moody’s incorrectly maintains an AAA rating on MBIA, these extremely risk-averse investors unwittingly buy bonds that are not deserving of Moody’s AAA rating.”

In addition to shorting the stock of MBIA, Ackman also purchased CDS, or Credit Default Swaps on MBIA’s debt. These swaps act as insurance in the case of credit events or solvency risks that the issuer of the debt may face. In exchange, the buyer is forced to pay annual premiums to the seller.

The premiums that Ackman paid on his MBIA CDS position put a massive drag on his overall returns for many years. Finally, in February of 2008, MBIA cut its dividend and suspended its structured finance activities. In June of the same year, MBIA and Ambac, the two largest municipal bond insurers, lost their AAA rating from Moody’s, and Ackman walked away with $1.2 billion of proceeds from the trade.\*

This particular bet showed Ackman’s conviction in his position, despite having dealt with criticism and drag on returns for many years. As Whitney Wilson, Co-Manager of T2 Partners, put it:

&gt;“For five years he was wrong, wrong, wrong. Then he made billions… He is the most relentlessly stubborn person on the planet.”

Hedging Bet #2

*Time Period: 2020*

*Investment Cost: $27 million*

*Total Proceeds: $2.6 billion*

*Multiple of Capital (MOC): 96.3x*

*Financial Instrument Used: Index CDS on Investment Grade and High Yield Bonds*

After a few years of underperformance relative to the S&amp;P due to positions such as Herbalife and Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Bill Ackman entered the financial limelight once again in 2020.

In February of 2020, Ackman began to worry about a pandemic-related economic recession. His hedge fund bought insurance policy through CDS on almost $71 billion worth of corporate debt, including $44.5 billion of U.S investment-grade bonds, $23.1 billion of an equivalent European index, and a $3.1 billion notional exposure to Europe’s high yield debt.

This bet was risky, to say the least, and required an enormous level of conviction due to the volatility it imposed on the fund’s portfolio. At its peak, this one position accounted for almost 40% of Pershing Square’s entire AUM. On March 13, when the S&amp;P jumped 10%, the value of the contracts had dropped by $800 million in just one day.

By the time Ackman appeared on CNBC on March 18, he had sold about half of the defensive hedge position. He then went on to use the proceeds to buy into many of his existing positions, while also adding a new position in the coffee chain Starbucks. As of March 31, Pershing Square had not only offset all the losses on their long-equity positions but had actually ended the quarter with substantial gains relative to the S&amp;P

One of the underappreciated aspects that allowed Ackman to pursue such a bold strategy lies in the unique structure of his hedge fund. In 2014, Pershing Square publicly-listed itself on the Euronext Amsterdam - the Netherlands stock market. So while a lot of hedge funds were facing capital calls from investors during the pandemic-related scare, Ackman had the resource of permanent capital. It is safe to say that he made good use of this opportunity.

Hedging Bet #3

*Time Period: Late 2020 - 2022 (Ongoing)*

*Investment Cost: $188 million*

*Total Proceeds: $1.4 billion*

*Multiple of Capital (MOC): 7.4x*

*Financial Instrument Used: OTM 2Yr and 10Yr Swaptions*

Towards the end of 2020, Pershing Square came to the conclusion that interest rates would substantially rise throughout the next few years. The thesis for this position was fueled by the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve and the U.S government.

As of December 2020, the unemployment rate was nearly 6.7% with CPI inflation at 1.4%. Due to QE and stimulus, Ackman was expecting both metrics to take substantial turns for the rest of 2021. By the end of 2021, this prediction turned out to be right, with unemployment falling to 3.9% as of December 2021 and CPI inflation ramping up to almost 7.0%.

To hedge against interest rate risk, Pershing Square purchased out-of-the-money interest rate swaptions starting towards the end of 2020. In January of 2021, they sold nearly 90% of the market value of the position, generating about $1.25 billion in proceeds. Since then, they have replaced this hedge with an additional longer-dated out-of-the-money swaption.

Swaptions, which stand for swap options, is a type of options contract which gives the buyer the right to enter into a swap contract on a specified date. These options are generally purchased in the over-the-counter market and are not traded on an exchange. This requires both the buyer and the seller to mutually agree on the notional amount, time period, and the fixed/floating rates involved with the instrument.

Swaptions come in two forms: payer swaptions and receiver swaptions. The payer swaption gives you the right to pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate of interest, usually the LIBOR rate. On the other hand, a receiver swaption is exactly the opposite.

To use an example, a borrower with loans maturing sometime within the next year might want to purchase payer swaptions to hedge against any substantial interest rate movement. If the variable interest rate, which is tied to LIBOR, moves above the fixed interest rate that was agreed upon, then the borrower would want to exercise the contract to pay the fixed rate instead.

Takeaways and Lessons

From studying Bill Ackman and Pershing Square’s track record of defensive hedging, there were 3 main lessons that we walked away with:

1. Only take bets in which you have large convictions. The market will often remain irrational longer than you would expect, or longer than you can remain solvent in many cases.
2. Look for bets with asymmetric payouts. This means limited upfront carrying costs and investments with opportunities to generate large multiples on your capital. This also means investments with a limited downside in cases where the potential risk does not transpire
3. Hedging is more lucrative on a short-term basis where the monetization of it can become a funding source for cheap equities during downturns. Continuous hedging strategies do work, but they will often put a drag on overall returns.",stocks,1645499180

42,6 reasons why AAPL isn't a pandemic stock,"It makes a lot of sense that a lot of companies are normalizing back to pre-pandemic pricing and pricing trends because people are slowly easing back to normal life.

AAPL is still up \~100% since the pandemic. What are the reasons why AAPL won't drop back down too?

Here are my 6 reasons:

* **People severely underestimated how much impact the Trump administration destroying Huawei phones had on Apple.** Apple benefited hugely as people bought iPhones instead of Huawei. In China, Apple is now the #1 smartphone maker again. Two years ago, I would have said this is impossible because of how strong Chinese phone makers have been and have been growing. In hindsight, the moment Trump announced the ban was the moment AAPL should have exploded.
* **5G super-cycle** came during the pandemic
* **Superior supply-chain management during the pandemic allowed Apple to gain market shares.** In the US, the iPhone has surpassed Android in marketshare, which I thought would never happen again.
* **Mac transitioned to Apple Silicon during the pandemic**, which is beating the pants off Intel and AMD chips in performance and performance per watt. Apple is now the fastest-growing computer maker and they're just getting started. The PC market is $150b/year, and Apple only has an 8% market share. If Apple is able to gain 20 to 30%, that's a very respectable increase in revenue.
* **Apple is expected to eventually enter some of the hottest markets during the pandemic** which were electric vehicles, self-driving cars, and the metaverse. While existing companies in those markets have dropped off, Apple hasn't even released a product for them yet. This means AAPL never actually caught the hype for these categories during the pandemic.
* **Investors never really caught onto Apple's new strategy until recently which involves gaining market share and selling services.** Apple is no longer just serving the premium markets. The old saying ""Apple products are overpriced"" is no longer true. For $330, you can buy a new iPad. $250 and get the iPhone SE. $400 and get an iPhone SE. And I'm guessing Apple is planning a cheap Macbook SE to take PC market share too. These are excellent value products and serve as the entry points into Apple's iron grip ecosystem. Once you're in with one product, you can't get out. Next thing you know, you're buying Airpods every 2 years, subscribing to Apple Music, getting Apple Fitness+, upgrading to a Macbook Pro, using Apple Pay which gives Apple a % of the transaction, buying virtual items in stupid mobile games, etc...",stocks,1645496866

68,Dow futures drop more than 400 points as tensions between Russia and Ukraine brew…. Tech down 2.5%,"Stock futures fell sharply on Monday night, as traders continue to monitor brewing tensions between Russia and Ukraine.

Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down by 454 points, or 1.3%. S&amp;P 500 futures slid 1.7%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were off by 2.4%.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Monday that he would recognize the independence of two breakaway regions in Ukraine, potentially undercutting peace talks with President Joe Biden. That announcement was followed by news that Biden was set to order sanctions on separatist regions of Ukraine, with the European Union vowing to take additional measures.

Putin later ordered forces into the two breakaway regions.

The news came after the White House said Sunday that Biden has accepted “in principle” to meet with Putin in yet another effort to deescalate the Russia-Ukraine situation via diplomacy. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the summit between the two leaders would occur after a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov

After the steep 30 % drop of russian stocks today, many price alerts got triggered and I am very tempted to build up a russian position for diversification. Most of it will be commodities which are soaring in price while the stock prices got hammered down (due to the swelling russia-ukraine war probably). I know that sanctions (the EU announced they will also place some) will hurt commodity export, but thats not my concern rn. There are also plans to place sanctions on the financial sector of russia, freezing assets etc. Could / will this disrupt, delay or even prevent the payment of dividend?

I have this mutual fund (WSTAX) that resulted in $9K capital gains redistribution that fucked up my taxes. I haven't put any money in it in ages as I bought it when I was less educated, and I now know it has an expense ratio too high for my comfort and has a tendency to let loose capital gains. Since it's not in my IRA, this is no good. I want to sell it, but, naturally, I'm worried about  taxes from that. However, it appears on my account that my gain on it is \*negative\*. It tells me I'm -$4100. This basically means if I sell it now, I can sell it as a loss, correct? That would end up helping me next tax year?

I'm guessing that the capital gains redistribution led to this as I've been in it for 4 years, and it's done fairly well, so I can't see me being negative form my initial investment. Does this sound right? I feel pretty stupid to have ended up in this situation. With the stocks weak, and likely going to be much weaker tomorrow, I feel like now would be a good time to dump it and invest it in VTI and VOO, which I am happier with.

I was going to use vanguard as suggested by Ali Abdaal who I first watched on investing but in Australia I can't find an s&amp;p500 index fund nor a asx200 index fund. Am I doing something wrong?

Reasons being:
1. It’s easy to create a twitter-like app, but it’s hard to do things like bot/spam removal. It seems they are not planning to do any large-scale content moderation, it’s very susceptible to spam/scam posts. This makes the overall user experience bad.
2. To bring in revenue, you can either run ads, or charge subscription for something, or a combination of both. Running ads is not as simple as it seems. Google/Twitter/Facebook engineers spent 10+ years iterating on their ad system. Their ads are delivered to the right audience, which is why they are bringing in so much money from the merchants who advertise on those platforms. Truth social, on the other hand, will not be able to out-compete the old platforms in terms of conversion efficiency (like how many dollars you have to spend to get someone click your ad, or how many dollars you have to spend to get someone actually buy the things you advertise). Advertisers would certainly rather spend their money advertising on Google/Facebook/Twitter than Truth Social.
3. Scalability and availability. Twitter has to spend a lot to make sure their product is scalable and always available. I’m not sure an App built in such a short time has the ability to solve those problems very quickly. We are already seeing sign-up/sign-in errors from everyone who tried.

Let’s discuss BABA pre earnings. Estimates are actually low, considering they had their largest singles day in history this past quarter and the ramp up to host the Olympics.

BABA has a $15B buy back program in place. We know they have already bought back $3.7B worth of shares at much higher prices. I would imagine they have doubled that purchase amount since NOV. will have a positive impact on EPS.

LAZADA - most people have NO clue BABA owns LAZADA. This is the Amazon of South East Asia and not only is it huge, but it’s growing at 81% per year. BABA said they plan for it to do $100B in GMV. To put that into perspective, Amazon does $600B. So just this teeny little segment of BABA that almost no one knows about, is set to do 1/6 of Amazon’s total business.

China has not only lowered their rates, while the US is raising rates, but they have also started multi billion dollar stimulus. I personally think there is going to be a bull run on China stocks. Look at their market compared to 2009 US market. It looks very similar.

The current situation of the world is not at the best (pandemic, war threat, job quit around the world, panic for a recession) but I am not too afraid, I understand that this is the market and you have to deal with stress and uncertainty constantly. Do you think I should worry less about the world and the performance of my investments, since I am young and there is time later?  Should I concentrate more on getting on a good career path? I am asking this because I don't think I have enough energy to get a good career and also learn about stocks and also living my life and it is all too much to deal with.",stocks,1645458040

* Dividend yield: Positive
* 52 Week High/Low: 30% or more below high
* Average volume: over 1M
* Option/Short: Optionable

62,Convertible Preferred Share Arbitrage,"Hey guys so I have been investing and trading for the past few years and I have continued to develop and research different strategies to implement and I came across a strategy that I found pretty interesting. Convertible Bond Hedging is a strategy that I am sure many of you have heard about which is essentially where you long a convertible bond of a company which converts into a set amount of common stock and then you short the equivalent number of common shares essentially creating a delta neutral position that makes money regardless of the movement of the prices in the form of the bond interest you receive however over the past few decades with more and more funds and institutions doing it the opportunities have gone down significantly, especially since more and more companies have stopped issuing them however I came across a similar security called a convertible preferred stock. It acts sort of like a convertible bond where it pays a dividend and each share converts into a certain number of common shares so my idea was could you theoretically long the preferred shares and short the common shares in an equivalent ratio to make the position delta nuetral? the issue I am running into is the price of the common shares is different than that of the preferred shares so I was also wondering how exactly do you keep the position delta neutral. any advice, suggestions or comments would be most appreciated",stocks,1645423408

64,The Google split,"So here is the quick rundown for Google. It’s currently 3 classes of shares. Class A ($GOOG), Class B (preferred) and class C (GOOGL). Both class A and class C should have the same value on the markets however the only difference is the Class C ($GOOGL) has 1x value of voting rights. This however is irrelevant as class B owns 10x the voting rights per share and is a majority ownership by Page and Brin. In short, not important.

So now the split. It is defined as an owner of any 3 of the class shares owned in July 1st will receive 19 additional shares on july 15th (20:1 split). 

Historically a stock split starts to run 30-60 days prior to stock split (see AAPL or NVDA as recent behemoths to do so). So price action will begin likely in May although this has no physical impact on the company as a whole… or does it?

Opinion piece: I believe that Google is doing this split for 1 main reason, to get onto the Dow Jones industrial average. At a 20:1 split at current prices Google shares will trade at about $130. An underperforming blue chip company in the Dow right now is IBM, which happens to be at $135, making it a relatively easy transfer. 

Naturally for funds to balance their portfolio they will buy the incoming company causing the stock price to rise as well once announced.

Given these are hypotheticals, I am also looking at googles growth, and in short their recent earnings has just been a blowout with more to come.

As a result, I will be entering a position of 20 shares of $GOOGL Tuesday morning and cost averaging on a monthly basis until May to put my money where my mouth is.

67,Inflation Protection Ideas,"Seeing lots of posts about inflation recently.  Thought it might be a good idea to review it and some options you have to defend against it.  And I will put my personal positions at the bottom.

From Deep Risk by Bernstein

**Deep Risk – Young investors series**

-	2 types of Risk
  - Shallow Risk – loss of real capital that recovers relatively quickly
  - Deep Risk – permanent loss of real capital
-	Permanent loss of capital (negative real return over a 30-year period)
    - Severe, prolonged hyperinflation – hurts stocks and bonds but bonds more
      - Wide diversification among international markets
      - A tilt toward value stocks and commodity producing companies
      - Gold bullion
      - Inflation protected securities and annuities
      - Fixed rate mortgages
  - Gold bullion protects poorly against inflation and currency shocks
  - Gold bullion does superbly with deflation
  - Gold bullion does best when the public loses faith in the financial system
  - Gold bullion is great for hyperinflation
  - PME do not protect against deflation or certain disaster scenarios like gold bullion does
  - You have to make choices as to what and how much you want to defend against
  - Stocks in the US have done best when inflation ran between 0-4%.
  - Stocks do protect against inflationary deep risk, but not in the short term. But they do protect against inflation in the long term
    - To put it another way stocks, protect against deep risk, but exacerbate shallow risk
  - Widespread diversification of stocks protects against inflation because it is unlikely that all nations would have massive hyperinflation at once
  - Inflation devastates bondholders. Especially when it is a surprise/unexpected.
 - Fixed rate mortgage payments are also good for inflation
  - A value tilt also provides protection against inflation. This worked in both domestic and international
  - Inflation is the most likely of the scenarios to play out. But is the easiest to protect against.
    - International diversification
    - Value Tilt
    - PME
    - Natural Resource Stocks
    - Retired people should use TIPS

Skating Where the Puck Was

-	When credit contracts during a crisis, investors reevaluate their risk tolerance, seek the comfort of government secured vehicles, and dump all their risky assets - ALL OF THEM
-	Short term crashes can be painful, but long-term returns are far more important to wealth creation and destruction
-	Resign yourself that diversifying among risky assets provides scant shelter from bad days or bad years, but that it does help protect against bad decades and generations. Which can be far more destructive to wealth

Rational Expectations

-	Stocks that have the potential to have high returns during crises, especially inflationary ones, should consequently have the lowest returns of all among equity classes (Like PME)
-	William Bernstein believes in 3 different industry groups for consideration into a portfolio
  1. REITs
  2. Precious Metal Equity (PME)
  3. Oil/Natural Resource Equity (NR)
-	Oil and Natural Resource stocks are a great inflation hedge and under appropriate circumstances, might not be unreasonable to have additional allocation to commodities producers
-	Don&amp;#39;t purchase commodity futures. They are great in theory but not in practice. There used to be &amp;quot;Backwardation&amp;quot; in the futures market when investors were scared on deflation in their products and needed downside protection (IE a farmer selling his wheat crop in 9 months). Now inflation is the primary concern and futures contracts are in a condition known as &amp;quot;contango&amp;quot; which drives up the costs and reduces future returns

4 Pillars

-	PM funds have low expected return. But they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. PM are also a hedge against inflation. But be careful with PM. Because you will be going against the market and you need to rebalance during. You will be selling when everyone on TV is saying to BUY and you will be buying when everything is good and people will tell you how dumb that is.

The only guide to alternative investments

-	REIT&amp;#39;s are a great choice. But do not invest in mortgage REIT&amp;#39;s as they are bonds and not equity
-	REIT&amp;#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds. This is true of domestic and international
-	International REIT&amp;#39;s can provide a benefit but their expenses tend to be higher so be careful. A 50/50 domestic and international REIT AA is a good starting place
-	Do not treat your personal home as a financial asset. It is a place to live. It should not be included in your overall AA plan
-	Investors who are not real estate professionals should gain exposure to REIT&amp;#39;s though low-cost mutual funds and not directly buy properties as a way to achieve broad diversification
-	REIT&amp;#39;s provide a reasonably good long-term hedge against inflation
-	5-15% is a good AA for REIT&amp;#39;s in your portfolio
-	TIPS provide a guaranteed rate of return and are less volatile than nominal return bonds
-	TIPS have a lower correlation to equities than nominal return bonds
-	Commodities (Hard Assets) have negative correlation to stocks and bonds and act as a hedge against event risk (wars, disruptions, political instability, etc.) and inflation. Usually made up of Energy, Industrial Metals, PM, Ag, Livestock
-	CCF&amp;#39;s do will during times of rising or unexpected inflation. But do poorly during times low or falling inflation
-	Larry Swedroe likes Collateralized commodity futures (CCF) and not the actual producers
-	William Bernstein likes commodities, but not CCF&amp;#39;s. He likes the actual commodity producers(Example - Oil and Materials). They won&amp;#39;t provide protection from Shallow Risk like the CCF will, but they will provide protection from deep risk.
-	PME&amp;#39;s have a low correlation to both stocks and bonds both domestic and international
-	Excellent hedge against inflation. Especially good for retired persons who need a hedge against inflation
-	There is a large rebalancing bonus (as much as 5%)
-	PME are HIGHLY volatile so be careful and rebalance
-	PME tend to experience long periods of very low returns during periods of economic and political stability and short periods of high returns in times of crisis

Global investing

-	There is a weak negative correlation between inflation rates and stock returns
-	The short-term relation between equity returns and inflation is weak, but over the long term equity returns impound inflation rates
  - In 1920&amp;#39;s Germany Hyperinflation, stocks hedged inflation well, but investors would have been better off if inflation didn&amp;#39;t take place
-	The negative relation between stocks and inflation is a short to intermediate term phenomenon. Over the longer terms, stocks behave as claims to real economics assets
-	Inflation is likely to remain a factor in society, primarily because governments spend more than they receive in taxes, forcing the governments to borrow. Monetization of this debt causes inflation.
-	Over the long term, real estate should provide returns competitive with those on stocks and bonds, and its low correlation with other assets makes it valuable for diversification. Real estate has also been a superior inflation hedge
-	Commodities futures have low correlations with other assets.
  - Commodities and bonds tend to act opposite each other
    - Why? Commodity futures are claims to real assets, while bonds are claims to money payments
-	Gold was more volatile than commodity futures but had a better return.
-	Commodity futures tracked inflation fairly well, but underperformed it

The delusions of crowds

-	Market Bubbles require 4 necessary conditions
  - Technological and financial displacement
  - Credit loosening
  - Amnesia of the past
  - Abandonment of time-honored valuation principles
-	Under most circumstances, the Federal Reserve cares about 2 things
  - Overall state of the economy (as measured by GDP growth and unemployment)
  - Keeping inflation under control
    - Stock prices are of lesser concern and often wind up a bystander of the other 2 policies
-	The Fed primary operates via the federal funds rate (interest rate at which member banks lend to each other overnight)
  - When interest rates on these are high, they attract investors. Which pulls investment from risk assets (stocks) and lowers their prices. The opposite is true

Asset Allocation

-	No liquid investment alternative with stable guaranteed principal exist that can provide real returns by consistently beating the combined impact of inflation and taxes
-	Governments are the primary beneficiaries of inflation, in part because of tax structures that tax nominal rather than real incomes
-	Common stocks do much better in a low inflation environment. They have performed poorly during deflation or high inflation, especially if the inflation is unexpected.
  - Over the longer run, the companies can make adjustments to inflation, but in the short run those adjustments are difficult to accomplish

A Random Walk Down Wall Street

-	Exercise 6 – Buy a house. Real estate is a great inflation hedge. REIT&amp;#39;s are a good choice to own commercial real estate
-	Exercise 8 – Gold can have a place in your portfolio (5%). It is a good diversifier and is an excellent inflation hedge. Don&amp;#39;t invest in diamonds or Collectibles. Buy diamonds and collectibles because you like them. Not as an investment. Do NOT invest in commodities futures contracts. You will get burned. Stay away from hedge funds, private equity, and venture capital funds. They are great for the managers, not for you

Stocks For the Long Run

-	Under a paper money standard, bad economic times are more likely to be associated with inflation, not deflation like the 1930&amp;#39;s. Under these circumstances, stock and bond prices tend to be more correlated. Thereby reducing the diversifying qualities of government bonds
-	Because of this it is unlikely that bonds will remain a good long-term diversifier, especially if inflation looms once again

-	Bonds are bad during inflation as they are fixed income investments whose cash flows are not adjusted for inflation.
  - It is also bad for the stock market. Stocks have proved to be poor hedges against inflation in the short run. But are great in the long run
-	Although fascinating to observe and understand a market&amp;#39;s reaction, investing on the basis of data releases (CPI, unemployment, etc.) is a tricky game and best left to speculators. Most investors will do well to watch from the sidelines and stick to a long-term investment strategy.

-	Inflation and Deflation have characterized history as far back as economists have gathered data. But since 1955, there has never been a single year in which the US consumer price index declined
-	Why the shift, because instead of Gold having control, now the government does and they always provide liquidity to prevent prices from declining
-	The market used to react more to fed policy. But investors have become so geared to watching and anticipating Fed policy that the effect of its tightening or easing is already in the market.
-	Stocks have an inflation hedge or an ability to maintain its purchasing power during periods of inflation
-	Since stocks are claims on the earnings of real assets, assets whose value is intrinsically related to the price of the goods and services they produce, one should expect that their long-term returns will not be harmed by inflation
-	Stock are not good hedges against inflation in the short term, but no financial asset is. In the long run however, stocks are very good hedges against inflation, while bonds are not
-	Smith&amp;#39;s Common Stocks and Long-Term Investments showed that stocks outperform bonds in times of falling and well as rising prices.
-	Fisher found that in theory, stocks will be an ideal inflation hedge
-	If inflation rears its head again, investors will do much better in stocks than bonds

Safe Havens

-	Gold
    - Hedge against the banking system.
    - No counter party risk.
    - Historically thought of as a hedge against inflation. But, is a very noisy hedge against inflation.
      - It is mostly tied to movements in real interest rates (When inflation goes up faster than nominal interest rates, real rates go down, pushing up gold prices).
    - Mildly explosive crash (market down 15%) payoff on average (30% in the 1970&amp;#39;s and 7% since) but, it has had a very wide range of returns since the 1970&amp;#39;s.
    - Gold is all about investors&amp;#39; expectations of value, it has no yield and has no intrinsic value.
      - It is for that reason impossible to fundamentally value. Its payoff profile is largely statistical as expected.
    - During the 1970&amp;#39;s, golds payoff profile made it very cost effective as a safe haven, outside of that, gold has been much less cost effective.
      - Gold has required a tactical call regarding inflation or real interest rates in order to be a cost-effective safe haven.
      - This means we need certain things to go right for gold to be an effective safe haven in mitigating systemic risk (of a crash), much less cost-effective.
      - The amount of gold needed to fully hedge our portfolio is very high adding to its carry costs.

IAA

-	REIT&amp;#39;s and Precious Metals stocks can have a place in a portfolio even if they have lower expected returns

I'm doing a high school math project for IB where I'm looking at the effects of inflation on the stock market. I researched and narrowed down to Wilshire 5000 and s&amp;p500 as the two indexes that best represent the overall American market. Which one should I choose? I'm thinking of Wilshire because it covers more companies but sp500 is well known and has the larger cap companies. Would it make a major difference as to which one I choose? 

Any insight would be helpful here.",stocks,1645415057
69,"The stock market fell, is the shadow of the financial crisis coming?","The stock market has fallen sharply recently. At present, domestic inflation is very serious and has exceeded the highest value in 40 years. Some Fed officials said a rate hike was imminent. That means the stock market could fall sharply.

And, historically, financial markets have had a financial crisis every 10 to 20 years. The current situation is high prices, high housing prices, high inflation, high debt. The basic conditions for the financial crisis are already in place. Monetary policy affects all of this.

&amp;#x200B;

I was looking into this company ""Blackstone"" which should be fairly popular. It is the largest Private Equity company.

&amp;#x200B;

Since I can't really value the company (DFCF seems not to work well) and the Stock had a bull run in the last months, I was wondering, what you guys think about the company.

&amp;#x200B;

I personally like the company (from the first impression) but I don't know, if the latest bull-run kind of overheated the stock...

&amp;#x200B;

The PE seems in line with the historic PE (maybe a bit higher). The Problem here is, that they had a rapid growth of Earnings and thus also a growth of stock price. Now the question is, will this growth decline or maybe even go negative? 

&amp;#x200B;

Also, I guess rate hikes won't do this company a favor... 

&amp;#x200B;

So im asking you:

&amp;#x200B;

Considering, that it is a great business but also considering the rate hikes and the bull run in the past few months - What ist your take on Blackstone?

75,"Do you think Cathie Wood is right to say: ""the idea of shorting innovation is, in America, ridiculous I think.""","A few days ago, Cathie Wood did an interview with CNBC where she talked about the bear market that technology stocks are currently facing.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Specifically, Wood responded to the launch of the Short Innovation ETF, an ETF created by Tuttle Capital Management that seeks to produce the inverse daily returns of Ark Invest's flagship Disruptive Innovation ETF.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Since its launch late last year, the SARK ETF has soared 55% while the ARKK ETF has declined by 42% over the same time period.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt; ""They're \[Tuttle Capital\] shorting innovation and that seems to me, over time, that's not going to be a business if you ask me. But they're also not doing any research. They're simply shorting innovation. If they were doing research and could point us to reasons why what we \[own\] is not going to participate in the new world order, then we might have a conversation about it. But the idea of shorting innovation is, in America, ridiculous I think,"" Wood said. 

In my view, she does have a legitimate point. Of course, I understand first that many technology stocks that achieved sky-high valuations during the pandemic did so only because of cheap money, low-interest rates, and behavioral and societal changes; and that the high valuations achieved are not sustainable nor are they justified. 

But, looking at the long term, shouldn't technology be in a bull market? The pandemic seems/feels like an inflection point for technology and advancements that those who fail to foresee and capture will be left behind. Things are only ever going to become more digitized, the way we live will change, so shorting innovative technology stocks in the long term seems foolish.

This is just my two cents. Of course, I understand the idea of waiting out the bear market to get a better entry point for most of these stocks, as the volatility due to the Russian-Ukraine tensions, Inflation, and interest rates make it difficult to enter currently.",stocks,1645411793

There is a lot of money to be made on the way down just as there was on the way up.

16,Macro Economics are in - Here's Where Nobody Is Looking," 

Hello -

Allow me to introduce myself.

My name is Charlie's Vids. I made YouTube videos going over the current events of the market last year.

I'll make this as brief as I can - but basically - I've spent the last year researching into the stock market / market policy implementation / market mechanics / etc.

You can find various documents / PowerPoints around tons of topics on my YT channel - but that's not the point.

I'm here to talk about what nobody is looking at, and what I've built to capture this opportunity. I honestly am going insane, because it's as clear as day - but despite that - NOBODY IS LOOKING.

***WHY?***

Because the media narrative, of course.

What am I talking about here?

Well.. please refer to the two pictures below:

[https://ibb.co/64BRNqz](https://ibb.co/64BRNqz) \- SPY 09/17/20 - TODAY

[https://ibb.co/vqTrH7v](https://ibb.co/vqTrH7v) \- MCHI 09/17/20 - TODAY

[https://ibb.co/d28wgqY](https://ibb.co/d28wgqY) Both combined / overlaid 9/17/20 - TODAY

So why are we starting from the 17th of September, 2020?

I'll run through this briefly, and then explain how I plan to tackle this.

***STEPTEMBER 17TH, 2019:***

FED Reserve enters to lend to banks as the ""Lender of Last Resort"". 14 Monetary Policy Facilities and Programs were create to combat the surging Covid19 Pandemic that had just surfaced during this time.

You can find more info on these claims here:

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-and-loan-facilities.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-and-loan-facilities.htm)

***MARCH 31ST, 2021:***

The Supplemental Leverage Ratio was in effect from April 1st, 2020 - March 31st, 2021. This basically allowed the banks to free up their liquidity and continue lending to banks and businesses during the pandemic.

The supplementary leverage ratio is the US implementation of the Basel III Tier 1 [**leverage ratio**](https://www.risk.net/definition/leverage-ratio), with which banks calculate the amount of common equity capital they must hold relative to their total leverage exposure. Large US banks must hold 3%. Top-tier bank holding companies must also hold an extra 2% buffer, for a total of 5%. The SLR, which does not distinguish between assets based on risk, is conceived as a backstop to risk-weighted capital requirements.

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm)

Going back and looking at the chart - you can clearly see the major indexes - not just the SPY - start to tank RIGHT INTO the timeframe leading into the SLR Monetary Policy.

THEN - during this time period - later that year in August of 2020, the ***THREE RED LINES POLICY*** was implemented by the Chinese Government, which was basically ***FORCED DELEVERAGING*** of major developers, likely a major player in the collapse of ***ARCHAEGOS*** that took place 6 months later in March of 2021, just a week shy of ***SLR EXPIRING.***

[***https://www.ubs.com/global/en/assetmanagement/insights/thematic-viewpoints/apac-and-emerging/articles/china-three-red-lines.html***](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/assetmanagement/insights/thematic-viewpoints/apac-and-emerging/articles/china-three-red-lines.html)

More info can be found at the link above.

So Archaegos collapses, SLR enables the biggest players to leverage themselves to the extreme - and then SLR expires.

Well - what happens after that? Now it gets interesting - because now - all of a sudden - the US has been LEVERAGING for the past 6 months, while the Chinese have been ***DELEVERAGING.***

(explaining the overlaid picture above)

There's one more thing that ties into this before I get into the trading part -

***THE REVERSE REPO MARKET.***  
[https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/desk-operations/reverse-repo](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/desk-operations/reverse-repo)

As soon as SLR expired in April - the repo started to surge to ***HISTORIC LEVELS*** not even close to being reached before.

***THIS IS WHERE MY RESEARCH COMES INTO PLAY.***

I know that due to the repo demand being so high - there is ***TONS OF COLLATERAL*** that are being created/redeemed via ETFs. If you query institutional ownership - there's almost 1,000+ tickers with institutional ownership ***OVER 100% -*** likely because they knew they needed the collateral.

***BLACKROCK, FIDELITY AND VANGUARD BOUGHT A TOTAL OF 11,000+ COMPANIES as per their 13GS filed around this time last year.***

***To remind: a 13G is a required filing when a company is purchased up 5% or more by an institution.***

*So* \-

DUE TO THE COLLATERAL BASKETS BEING CREATED , AND A LACK OF LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET -

***EXHAUSTION GAPS ON THE DAILY CHARTS ARE BEING CREATED - AND SPECIFICALLY ON EARNINGS - BECAUSE THEY ARE CONTROLLING THE MARKET VIA OPTIONS' EXERCISION .***

***This applies to NON-RETAIL STOCKS*** with low liquidity.

The gaps on the MACD created an oblong ""banana"" looking shape on the DAILY.

You think I'm bullshitting?

Go look at KIRK / AGLE / OLLI / SFIX / SPWH / BBIO / CBIO just to name a few.

**I've developed an entire strategy around this, and this is the DISCORD SERVER I'VE BUILT that I feel I should start getting out there.**

I confirmed with the bot developers that this hasn't been done, so please come check it out.

discord. g g/fudstop

I guess I can't post pictures here without uploading, but let me just give you an idea of how I've setup / programmed our discord:

***PULL FILINGS FROM DISCORD***  
***PULL UPCOMING EARNINGS FROM DISCORD***  
***75 NEWS FEEDS WITH FILTERABLE TOPICS***  
***PULL MAX PAIN FROM DISCORD***  
***PULL FIB RETRACEMENT FROM DISCORD***  
***+ several other commands***

What sets us apart is this:

I've organized the discord by SECTOR, and then within the sectors are their respective INDUSTRIES.

I have golden sweeps / dark pool flow / unusual options / quant alerts / setup on EVERY TICKER IN THE MARKET, FILTERED AND ORGANIZED BY SECTOR.

Yes - that's right. I literally spent two weeks formatting and manually inputting every single ticker into the market so we could visualize the sector rotation in as close to real time as possible.

Basically - in a nutshell - US/CHINA has been working together to stabilize the global economy while displaying a guise of ""divide and conquer"".

There's an opportunity out there that's going to miss a lot of people - and it's going to be these chinese ADRs that were spun-off illegally by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to avoid margin calls from the fallout of Archaegos.

Believe me or not - I've left all the resources for you to go and research this - all of my work so you can fact check my credentials - and I've left you the invite to our discord so you can see for yourself what I'm talking about.

I'm shadowbanned on twitter and youtube, and hated on wallstreetbets and superstonk because I speak the truth about psychological manipulation when it comes to social media - but anyways -  
I wanted to at least give one more avenue my two cents.

If you want to chat more about this - please, don't hesitate. Happy to have a conversation about this with anyone who may have knowledge on these topics.

They are doing well in online shopping but margins are not great because it’s less tech and more labor management &amp; customer service, which can’t scale as fast as pure labor free well written non rushed software (Google search, Microsoft office products, gmail, YouTube, Maps, etc)

Also majority of online shopping is third party marketplace who are always scared of cheap knock offs driven by fake reviews and Amazon basics so I don’t think growth there is sustainable. 

Facebook:

Just set of dying apps. We all know that no one really spends that much time on Facebook, Instagram, messenger &amp; whatsapp. They might have daily active users but those daily active users don’t really spend more than few mins on the app. Most of the communities and groups in these social media apps are ghost towns. They don’t rally own any mobile or desktop platform.

All the talk about meta verse is just the talks. It’s basically multi player real time game with VR which is not very new. Games (MetaVerse) can do well but it can also easily be very boring.

Netflix:

Yet another streaming app with all content being more than 30 mins. Even if they come up with great content, No one really has attention span of more than 10 mins these days. Netflix also hasn’t even developed a proper search engine in these many years. I watch more content on YouTube and TikTok than all streaming apps combined. No wonder YouTube revenue is similar to Netflix.

What’s the common problem with Amazon, Facebook and Netflix?

They are all tech companies with fear based culture. Engineers are always on their toes cutting corners to meet deadlines for next quarter so they don’t get fired in next performance cycle. So they never take long term risk or invest in big bets because big failure is not an option. Because they cut corners they also accumulate technical debt over time so basically talented engineers eventually spend more time keeping the lights on rather than innovating on new projects. 

Facebook and Netflix hire the top most tech talent and they have no rule rule. But none of their engineers ever came up with disruptive new tech and they are still basically a streaming app after so many years. Facebook similarly had to acquire innovations (Instagram, WhatsApp) because their engineers are too scared to get fired to innovate. 

I am also not long on Nvidia, AMD and all other companies whose products are not diversified.

31,What normalization mode should I use when calculating stock movement,"Hi all;

I am writing an app to determine what stocks to buy and sell. Fundamental to this i what normalization mode do I use for stock prices. If the stock splits 2:1, do I then work off the new lower price, and go adjust all my indicators to work off that price.

Or should I normalize it so I keep an adjusted price (i.e. double the new price) and when I order, when I determine to purchase 60 shares, it actually purchases 120 shares.

And same question for adding in the value of dividends paid ([nice explanation here](https://www.quantconnect.com/docs/algorithm-reference/initializing-algorithms#Initializing-Algorithms-Selecting-Asset-Data)).

I can see pluses and minuses for each approach. And I'm guessing that either approach has the same problems, it just moves where it needs to be handled.

32,Thinking of buying DBX? Maybe you should read this first.," When I’m considering opening a position in a company I do a lot of research into its sentiment. Not only how the public and the investors feel about the company, but just importantly, how its current and former employees feel about it. 

One of the sources I consult when doing my sentiment research is Glassdoor, which is an American website where current and former employees anonymously review companies. 

As of me writing this post, there are 918 reviews for DBX listed on the site. 

· The company has an over-all rating of 4.3/5.0

· 82% would recommend working there to a friend.

· 85% of current and former employees approve of the current CEO Drew Houston. 

&amp;#x200B;

It’s important to note that Dropbox is an *engaged employer* on Glassdoor, which basically means they actively interact with a lot of these posts. FYI, Dropbox cannot alter or remove these Glassdoor reviews. 

On the surface these ratings looks great, but it’s only when you delve deeper that you start to notice some recurring trends/red flags in a lot of these reviews. 

Now I mentioned earlier in the post that I do a lot of research, what I mean by that is that I read A LOT. So yes, I have sat here and read through a vast amount of these reviews. There are over 900 and there’s only like 8 per page so no I have not read all 900 but I have read a considerable amount to gain a good insight into the sentiment towards the company. 

Here’s a few random things to note that will be relevant later:

· It’s hard to find a bad thing said about the CEO Drew Houston as an individual. He is well liked as a person.

· Since Covid began Dropbox employees starting working remotely. Despite Covid letting up, this practice has now been adopted by the company across the board with all employees now expected to work remotely for the foreseeable future.  

· The verdict is out on how well they get paid, a lot of people said the pay and benefits were good, while others contradicted that. 

· Employees typically enjoy the working culture and feel valued and cared for. This however appears to be in somewhat of down trend which I will elaborate on later.

**I will summarize the following quotes at the end, so if you don’t want to read them, scroll down past the massive wall of text to the summary section.** 

# Cons &amp; advice to management, quoted from approximately 200 of the most recent reviews:

*“Technology stack is a little old, and progress is slow”*

*“Typical growing pains for a large organization. Dropbox is at a pivotal moment to adapt their existing products and evolve with the current demands of the market.”*

*“Needlessly political - Lots of talk of ""virtual first"" - company actually limits your ability to work away from your starting location to 90 days a year, unless you make a permanent move. This is also NOT a differentiator, as most tech companies work remotely now. - Wasteful investments, lack of vision - former CMO spent millions on a new web experience with questionable goals, then management had paid media team devote time to buy ""cheap"" traffic driving to said site - Company relies too much on perks to retain employees rather than developing employees, establishing a vision employees can buy into, and eliminating toxicity and politics”*

*“remote work not so great to collaborate”*

*“Have not met many people in person due to COVID.”*

*“limited company development potential - frequent reorg”*

*“Not sure about the future of the company”*

*“No direction Bad management and politics Constant reorgs, advice to management,* *Sell.”*

*“Poor direction, rash decisions, and horrible work/life balance leads the great people to leave consistently at all levels and roles.”*

*“Continuing to see deterioration in quality of people managers Talent is less strong than two years ago”*

*“permanent virtual is quite challenging”*

*“Cons, Turnover in middle &amp; upper management. For example, I've seen two CTOs come and go pretty quickly, which left me with a lack of confidence that leadership was seeing the company succeed in the long-term. \* I've seen multiple attempts of Dropbox attempting to push for a significant new product direction (e.g. new Spaces direction), only for it to get killed later on. This didn't give me a lot of confidence that the company knew how to evolve it's product portfolio. \* Some parts of the organization (e.g. Core Systems) had toxicity present, which caused trust problems, mental health issues, and turnover.*

*Advice to Management, Figure out a more effective strategy to nail new product direction such that you have less instances of build --&gt; kill products \* Figure out how to build a long-term, sustainable middle / upper management team that is going to help the company succeed in the long-term \* Figure out ways to deduce out at the org level if there are toxic workplace cultures present and get them dealt with”*

*“Uncertain future direction of product”*

*“Some unclear product direction from upper level management”*

*“Shifting strategies - although recent year the strategy is panning out really well.”*

*“Fully remote working, however remote working comes with its own benefits”*

*“Cons, Entirely remote so if you don’t like that, you probably won’t like Dropbox. Personally I was hesitant at first but love it now but I know some people prefer hybrid - The company seems to have slowed down a bit with some upper management churn. They seem to have a clear multi-product vision we’re working towards but only time will tell*

*Advice to Management, Continue treating your employees well and keep working towards a multi-product future. Fail fast and heavily invest in promising new products.”*

*“Lack of a clear career growth plan”*

*“can't go into an office full time again if you would like to”*

*“Cons, No upward mobility - High Manager/Leadership attrition (never seen so many leaders leave especially in a company that's known for culture) - political biases favor promos in terms of business needs versus actual talent. - Favors external hiring versus growing M4s up. - No diversity focus for middle management (front line - director), unfair gender biases - Hiring new leaders after virtual interviews has lowered hiring bar for leaders causing issues in leveling between peers*

*Advice to Management, Focus on growing your internal talent more, especially around leaders. Focus on diversity growth. Dropbox seemed to go well in that direction, pre-IPO”*

*“No more food, no more offices”*

*“stocks more or less stagnant (some action last year) -projects are randomly generated and assigned and no one really digs deep into why we are working on a year long project without proper goals -higher management is mehhh except few”*

*“Virtual first: Personally I would rather be back in the office but I've had good career opportunities which have convinced me to stay - Reorg: Usually have a company re-org every year. This year's (2021) was smaller in scale”*

*“Large company size which can lead to silos”*

*“expect change! Reorgs can happen frequently so this would be a con if you're someone who doesn't enjoy change. Personally I like how things change”*

*“Stock has gone up but isn’t a rocket ship. Bummer.”*

*“We don’t get to see each other in person since we no longer have office spaces”*

*“had some leadership turnover in 2020 but things have stabilized, stock price fairly stagnant”*

*“Product Priority and Company Identity has only stabilized last year.”*

*“People avoid hot/uncomfortable discussions \* It is really important to talk about metrics, failures and whether things are working or not. I see a lack of retrospective and some people are just too chill and in rest n vest mode. \* Stock price didn't move for a long time after IPO but recently started catching up (60% up since last year) so we have to wait and watch”*

*“Organizational changes with internal structure have been challenging at times (but we are on a great path now)”*

*“No office so ""culture"" might be suffering a little bit Not alot of interactions with members outside of your own team and/or stakeholders”*

*“Business strategy and sometimes there is turnover”*

*“Hey the pandemic has taught us that we can work remote better than we all thought! The downside...some things can only really happen in person. All those serendipitous encounters, relationships built in the time before/after meetings, and hey who doesn't miss the food, snacks, coffee bar, and weekly happy hours! On the other hand, saving 2+ hours per day commuting is pretty sweet.”*

*“Poor decision making - Senior leadership needs to be replaced”*

*“vague, constantly thrashing strategy - slow, plodding execution - management can be political - rapid employee burn &amp; churn.. even before the layoffs”*

*“Lots of changes (completely understand the need) - growing pain for a company turning around”*

*“Cons, the company is going through a re-birth of sorts and with it makes it feel like a start-up at scale, which can create some serious bottlenecks. my hope is this is more like flexing a new muscle that'll get better with some time - there are still some significant working silos that can cause frustration when projects end up going nowhere*

*Advice to Management, get more departments talking to one another to have everyone on the same page keep the open dialogue going with the company, it's helping maintain confidence in staff and the future of Dropbox”*

*“TONS of turnover Lots of tech debt Nonsensical product decisions (desktop app?) Few opportunities for impact in core product”*

*“Needs to spend money on change management consulting. I believe Dropbox has an inferiority complex compared to its former peers (Facebook, Twitter, etc). Thus, they think they have the internal knowledge and resources to effectively implement change in the ever changing tech landscape. Newsflash: they don’t. And they hurt people every time they perform an org change. -Promotion path is below average at best. -High turnover, especially in key leadership positions -Difficult to avoid burnout. -Lastly, people are so tired. Managers, ICs, executives. When will there be a change for these people?”*

*“Not a “startup” anymore, and not really an innovative company. Just cutting costs and trying not get noticed by users that forgot they’re still paying.”*

*“Cons, Trying to remain necessary and part of folks online experience is tough in this landscape*

*Advice to Management, Support leadership and IC's w clear roadmaps”*

*“Cons, Boring work -- Users don't really want new features, but Dropbox has 1000's of employees that need to justify themselves. The execs give impossible goals to the directors, who give ambiguous goals to the product teams, so there is low accountability and a lot of turnover.*

*Advice to Management, Shrink the company &amp; just be a great file sync product with $2 billion / year in revenue. That's good enough. Stop trying to expand the product's surface area, because our users don't want it.”*

*“Technical stack is very complex. Takes a long time to ship anything related to the core product. Some entitlement culture. Remote first is not for everyone; we have seen a good amount of attrition recently.”*

*“Projects could have unclear direction, room for growth may be limited”*

*“Lots of new products, hard to roll them out”*

*“I think the main challenge that Dropbox has is a sub-optimal development infrastructure which significantly slows down development. The company is investing in fixing as it should, but the experience is generally slow as of today.”*

*“Leadership, strategy, Org structure, HR, culture”*

*“Remote onboarding is definitely challenging. May not have as many product streams compared to bigger companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft etc.”*

*“There's been too much turn around since the beginning of 2021 and re-orgs amongst the teams which has created a inconsistency in the work and priorities”*

*“People stay at dropbox on average much longer than other tech companies but turnover happens.”*

*“Cons, There's still a lot to get right and plenty more ways to fail. Dropbox had a really stupendous and early success but has struggled to successfully expand its offerings in a meaningful way yet. That makes this period extra exciting still (read: opportunity for real impact), but the company is still in somewhat of a transitional stage as it works to transition into a successful multi-product company. The product culture that grew around nurturing and optimizing an established and mature product does not work for nurturing early stage bets, and the company is still trying to figure out how to do this better.”*

*Advice to Management, Continue treating employees as whole people, and continue prioritizing diversity—not just common quota demographics, but other meaningful areas like diversity of training/education/upbringing, and diversity of thought. Also, make more space for early bets and less mature ventures to have more autonomy and move faster, remove organizational red tape, and provide better infrastructural support.”*

*“slow career growth not so good management teams continuously re-org, change directions not so well motivated”*

*“If we can bring some of our work to the market sooner, and more frequently, I believe we will be much closer to our next innovation cycle. So yes, tons of potentials and opportunities at Dropbox.”*

*“No more tuck shop food”*

*“Could be more innovative. No offices is a little sad.”*

*“Lots of documentation and lots of re-org.”*

*“Cons, Staff turnover and reorgs leave employees a bit lost - Compensation is not the greatest in tech”*

*Advice to Management, Employees are our customers - they can choose a different company to work for at any point. Business continuity means that we need to think about attrition as a business threat and really focus on the employee experience - even when we need to change priorities to move fast.”*

*“Cons, Dropbox spent its first 10-12 years growing its culture, and for many of them, it was a top workplace to be part of. During covid, Dropbox forgot that this was something they ever valued. During the change to all remote work, Dropbox gained millions in overhead, but where did it go? There isn't going to be a lot of successful movement within dropbox, at least if you want to have career growth*

*Advice to Management, Start investing in your employees again because the money that went into the culture environment is no longer there and it certainly hasn't found its way to the employee yet. The good news for you is that over time, the people who knew the company when it treated their employees as Dropbox was known for will be gone and people who work there because it's ""tech"" and who don't want to live in a city can do so. You'll pay lower salaries and nothing for culture, but you get what you pay for.”*

*“No longer a growth company ""Virtual first"" is not for everyone Culture/perks are a shell of former self”*

*“Not the great unicorn it used to be.”*

*“Remote work makes it hard to maintain company culture”*

*“Nothing new to work on”*

*“The amount of change in my org has been distracting but I feel the company now has the best plan forward”*

*“decisions are made a bit quickly -the company feels a bit too big and it's hard to get things done”*

*“Virtual First has created a lot of uncertainty. Leadership historically does not have the greatest track record.”*

*“Cons, One side of Dropbox is this really strong consumer product driven by some of the best engineering and design talent in the industry. The other lesser known side of Dropbox is the B2B sales division run with absentee, toxic management and almost zero accountability. It's this awkward, failing experiment. The deals are somewhere between smb and MM which calls into question the label of ""Enterprise."" Management has been operating in a vacuum and there is no reason to believe that will change. Sales is dominated by transactional, short term thinking and arrogance is rampant. Professionalism does not exist internally or customer facing. The Management playbook consists of unethical, HR and \[potentially\] GDPR violating strategies (consider the faux security concerns used to manipulate customers into buying). ""Sellers ""are mostly ""account managers"" focused almost exclusively on up-selling existing books of businesses which in most cases are over sold.*

*Advice to Management, Look closely at your existing ""managers."" There has been so much unnecessary friction created through the use of strong arm selling. If anyone took even a casual look at some of the actions of previous and current ""managers"" I imagine there would be some additional changes made to the staff, rather quickly.”*

*“Working at Dropbox as a Growth Manager can be incredibly boring”*

*“New management directions are not the best”*

*“I don't know what management wants, and I don't think they do either. They say we're pivoting away from enterprise, but they send out emails bragging about salespeople selling new enterprise installs (some of which are clearly too large for our tech to handle, and will be refunded soon). They say they want to focus on core &amp; technical debt, but they're not willing to issue codes on any of the company-wide issues holding up productivity. Some parts of the company are trying to transition toward more AWS, some parts are trying to transition away from the AWS we already have. And lastly, virtual first. I joined because the blog post talked about using studios to maintain our existing culture and that we could work where &amp; how we wanted. It's become clear that we'll only be able to work from our own homes unless we spend a lot of our own money. Nobody even knows what the purpose of studios will be. I thought VF was going to be a new, more enlightened way of working, but it turns out it's just a half-baked plan to cut costs. Disappointing.”*

*“management, lot of change, change not comminucatied”*

*“Moving to a fully remote platform permanently has created a rift in the company, while many others are opening up we are making it challenging to collaborate and work in person. In addition, due to some changes internally processes and promotions have been made more difficult. Finally, the pay tends to be lower than the average.”*

*“growth slowly growth slowly growth slowly growth slowly”*

*“Culture is dwindling with remote work.”*

*“Product development cycle is slow”*

*“Product strategy and vision is still stabilizing and maturing”*

*“lack of direction, not everyone has high work ethic”*

*“Leadership changes too often which can make it hard to make long term gains.”*

*“Cons, In the past 18 months the amount of reorganization’s has made it difficult to focus. The company was almost changing too rapidly and shifting gears constantly when the goal remains the same. They are throwing baloney at a wall while figuring out their 2nd act.*

*Advice to Management, Try to space out the changes or make decisions with complete intention and commit to them.”*

*“Leadership, Lack of Direction/Strategy, Internal Politics, ""Virtual First"" Costcutting”*

*“Growth rate is slowing down now and not many interesting projects going on Company is cutting some great perks forever, such as the awesome office and café”*

*“Dropbox Business product (sales) struggling against Microsoft/Google”*

*“Top down planning, less innovation post IPO. Still would recommend this place highly. I miss working there. :)”*

*“Cons, - Promos are more based on politics and who your manager is than actual work performance - Management has no idea what they’re doing. There are re-orgs and a new company strategy every six months, which introduces tons of chaos without any results. The company is just slowly dying - Permanent remote policy. If you would prefer to work in an office part or full-time, you’re out of luck. Management tried to disguise this as embracing a new way of working but they’re just trying to cost-cut - The company’s focus is now cost-cutting: layoffs, cutting promotions, moving remote, etc. This, plus lack of faith in leadership, has created low morale and a lot of turnover. But the company seems set on cutting costs at all costs and does not care that it is driving all the good talent away*

*Advice to Management, You’ve completely lost employees’ trust at this point. Prioritizing $ over everything else is just going to lead to a downward spiral where people continue to leave and we continue to have to cut cost”*

*“As the years grow post IPO, Dropbox is naturally moving to a more corporate environment and has lost the charm and unique culture that has defined the company for so long. Also the company has struggled with maintaining momentum and motivation admist change.”*

*“Unclear business outlook, constantly shifting top down strategies and leadership”*

*“Lots of exec turnover, slow decision making, too much debate, too little action”*

*“Horrible management. 35% attrition rate. Management tends to put all the blame for failures on engineers.”*

*“product is a hard sell”*

*“confusing internal processes, lot of recent change”*

*“There is no accountability for leadership when they make decisions, fail, and change their mind about what they said months later. Organizational execution falls short with the constant reorgs that take place every few months. Declining stock price makes it less worthwhile to work here vs other companies which have had excellent growth over the past few years. Annual reviews are highly dependent on how your relationship with your manager and your manager's clout in the company. If you have a bad manager you're outta luck. All the best benefits are gone with the culture and old employees who've already moved on”*

*“Cons, Culture implosion since 2020. Exec leadership is all new and only interested in chasing a stock price increase which they are failing at very quickly.*

*Advice to Management, Stop blaming past leaders for everything that is not working. Make some real contributions to be worthy of trust!”*

*“Incredibly bad long-term strategy, trying to derive profits from cost cutting rather than innovation. Gemini was complete failure After acquisition, compensation was significantly lower than peers”*

*“very siloed organization, hard to complete projects”*

*“Cons, I joined Dropbox based on their vision of a smart workspace solution, but reality turned out to be all pomp and circumstance vs an actual product roadmap. New marketing leadership that was introduced in Q2 2020 was extremely inept in team building, transparency and connecting the dots in terms of how to leverage the incredible TAM at their fingertips. Said marketing leadership introduces and justifies more layers through multiple senior level hires for two consecutive quarters while laying off 25% of marketing staff last month. C-suite continues to deflect when asked probing questions about shifts in strategic vision and move to virtual first. A lot of lip service in place of accountability. 2020 was a make or break year for Dropbox, and 2021 will be the slow but inevitable decline of the company. Flatline of stock price.*

*Advice to Management, Drew really should step down and hand over the company to someone who knows what he/she is doing.”*

*“Changes in corporate strategy seem to be more frequent than others places I've worked at.”*

# Summary:

· Lack of faith in senior management and leadership, in particular the CEO. 

· Lack of vision and direction, particularly from senior management. No long term strategy. 

· Constant internal reshuffling of management and projects. The constant reshuffling of management leads to the failure of long term projects.

· High employee turn overrate. 

· Remote working is largely seen as negative. 

· Uncertainty for the future with concerns about the lack of innovation and growth. 

· Concerns about competitors such as Google, Microsoft etc. 

· Work processes are typically slow. 

· There is possibly some short sighted emphasis on stock performance. For example, the focus is on short term projects not long term projects. 

· A lot of the people who wrote these reviews are software engineers etc, they understand start-up tech companies and understand what is being doing right or wrong.

# My take:

This company once enjoyed a great working culture. However, since Covid they appear to have dropped the ball somewhat in regard to their core values and as such the working culture has gown downhill and is fastly becoming a thing of nostalgia. 

Remote working is the main contributor to this. A lot of people said they didn’t mind it and liked aspects of it, but most warned others that it may not be for them. Newer employees who started work during the pandemic stated they hadn’t even met colleagues face to face yet and didn’t know when they would. Others were upset that they no longer got free food, and found it sad that the company doesn’t even have offices anymore. 

You should also consider this about the remote working:

The idea of Dropbox is perfect for Covid, it promotes remote working. This is why I believe the company has taken this approach of full remote working. Because it promotes what their brand is all about. Based on that, I don’t see them shifting away from it anytime soon. 

There has been major reshuffling of staff over the last 18 months. Staff turnover based on these comments appears to be of a very high level, but I have not researched the figures myself. It’s perhaps something you should look into, because in an industry like this you want the best people working for you, especially when you are trying to innovate and grow. I believe the good working culture Dropbox enjoyed in its early days was very much part of its success, and with the fading of that that culture comes higher staff turnover which ultimately means losing the best the industry has to offer.  

As I said earlier, it’s hard to find a bad thing said about the CEO as a person, he is liked. But unfortunately being liked as a person and being a good leader doesn’t always go hand in hand. 

There is a lack of confidence in senior management taking this company forward. 

There are no real long term goals; the focus is on short term projects, possibly with an eye on the share price.

**Criticisms of the information I present:**

· Fake reviews:

I did not find any evidence to suggest that these reviews have been fabricated. - Personally I believe them for the most part to be a true and accurate reflection of current and previous employee’s views. Please note however, that it is not unheard of for reviews to be fabricated. 

· Disgruntled current/former employees:

It’s entirely possible that disgruntled former employees may have posted scathing reviews in attempt to tarnish the company’s reputation. - From what I have seen, almost all of these reviews have plenty of positive things to say about the company. There are far more positive comments then criticisms. The site automatically asks you about the cons. 

· Cherry picking quotes:

I have only selected quotes that suit my narrative. – These quotes were selected from approximately the 200 most recent reviews of the company. I did not include any pros mentioned, only criticisms as they were largely irrelevant. I didn’t include cons that were irrelevant. If you wish to review the pros of the reviews please refer to the linked webpage.

Current and former employer sentiment towards a company can be very valuable and provide you with a rare insider view of how a company is run and what it’s doing.

34,What's your YTD?,"So we're going through a ""market correction"" right now. Most people lost money.

In a way, I feel lucky I got away better than others. I keep telling myself: Things will be better in the long run. I invest long term. I just have to hold. I only lose money when I close (plus margin cost). No rush.

 But the money lost still hurts. Not being careful enough makes me feel undisciplined. Opening up the app every day to see more red isn't fun anymore. Uncertainty about near term future persists.

39,List of cognitive biases to be aware off when investing.,"I came across this and thought it would be useful to list some of the biases that can hinder our investment strategies.  

&gt;“The first principle is *that you must not fool yourself, a*nd you are the easiest person to fool.”  
Richard Feynman

Here is a list of biases I summarized from this infographic below.

* **Self-Serving Bias**: price *drop is due to market manipulation, but our success is due to our genius picks.*
* **In-Group Favouritism**: *do I even need to explain this here on /stocks*
* **Bandwagon Effect**: *ditto*
* **Groupthink**: ditto
* **False Consensus**: We believe more people agree with us than is actually the case. *This is when you fomo and end up getting wrecked*
* **Curse of Knowledge:** *You know that most people can't beat the market and can't explain why newbies keep coming up with the same set of questions.* 
* **Naïve Realism**: We believe that we observe objective reality and that others are irrational, uninformed, or biased. 
* **Dunning-Kruger Effect**: The less you know, the more confident you are. The more you know, the less confident you are. You see this with seasoned investors vs newbies all the time.
* **Google effect (aka Digital Amnesia**): We tend to forget information that’s easily looked up in search engines. *haha*
* **Belief Bias:** We judge an argument’s strength not by how strongly it supports the conclusion but by how plausible the conclusion is in our own minds. Just remember its very easy to convince yourself.
* **Declinism**: We tend to romanticize the past and view the future negatively, believing that societies/institutions are, by and large, in decline. Just look at the current sentiment here when market drops.
* **Confirmation Bias**: oh look this post is exactly what I was thinking it must be right
* **Falsification bias** is the opposite of confirmation bias. Oh look this article must be shit because it saying something bad about (XXX) pick your favorite industry / stock .
* **Sunk Cost Fallacy (aka Escalation of Commitment)**: We invest more in things that have cost us something rather than altering our investments, even if we face negative outcomes. T*his one is by far one the most dangerous fallacy when it comes to investing.*
* **Gambler’s Fallacy**: We think future possibilities are affected by past events. *Technical analysis anyone?*
* **Framing Effect**: We often draw different conclusions from the same information depending on how it’s presented. *Again look at reddits comments.*
* **Out-Group Homogeneity Bias**: We perceive out-group members as homogeneous and our own in-groups as more diverse. Just look at how much confusion there is people wondering why half the people have different opinions.
* **Survivorship bias**: We tend to focus on those things that survived a process and overlook ones that failed. *Again vey dangerous when analyzing the market.*
* **IKEA Effect**: We place higher value on things we have partially created ourselves. Again, its easy to get obsessed over a stock you were in early on.

I invested in Cathie Wood stocks, weed stocks, SPACs, and other unprofitable companies that kept being recommended on reddit and YouTube. It didnt end well.

I made a resolution to change my ways in the last week of December 2021. In the midst of a ""tax loss harvesting"" narrative going on in the media. I decided to start buying profitable companies, ones that pay dividends, and index funds. So I sold all those Cathie Wood, meme, unprofitable stocks after being down 25% on them and put that into things like WM, LEN, GS, JPM, FB, SPY, VOO, and some other stocks the first week of January 2022. 8 weeks later that turned out to be the top for many of the stocks I bought and now I am down 35% on my capital.

Am I screwed for several years? It is at a point where people are saying stocks entry points that were dreamed about last year aren't good enough. Fintech and homebuilders being two examples of it. It is feeling like it could be years before I recover from these losses and investing isnt as easy as my friends told me when I got into it in January 2021.",stocks,1645376358

My question is: Would you buy your kid the same stocks YOU chose based on your own DD, especially at these low prices or go with an index etf longterm. 

In other words, take a calculated risk on lower-mid cap growth stocks, or go safe into an index and make 7% compound annual growth over 20-30yrs.

I believe theres a lot of discounts in the market so its time to nibble and consistently add over time. What are your high conviction stocks that are in value territory and why? 

For example: will Walmart and Costco be the market leader 30yrs later? Mcdonalds probably.. Will Google still be the #1 visited website in the world? What do you think is the next FAANG stock. These are the type of questions that are on my mind.

""I don’t want to see this happen to someone else’s sister, daughter or wife,"" he added. ""Uber needs to protect its drivers more and it starts here with Christi.""

I’m currently in my final year of university and I have a module in which we are put into groups and take control of “a client’s portfolio” worth $100k, where we are to invest the money and try and make a profit, all while being able to support our decisions using fundamental and technical analysis of the stocks e.g. CAPM, EPS etc.

For a bit of context, our made-up client is a early 40s male, with a high paying job in law and strong ethical views. We need to create this portfolio with around 15 stocks that will create a well diversified portfolio (globally &amp; industry) while staying aligned with this person’s beliefs. 

As the client is high earning, we are not looking for stocks with high paying dividends as they are not needed and will get taxed in the highest tax bracket. Also due to his strong ethical views we’re not going to be investing in companies such as the British American Tobacco Company etc. for obvious reasons. 

In this made up scenario, this portfolio would be kept for 20+ years as a retirement fund but seen as we have a presentation in 5-6 weeks we’d love to see some green arrows before then if possible! 

As we’ve only been working on this for just over a week we only have 2 stocks currently in the portfolio: Tesla (TSLA) and NVIDIA (NVDA).

Briefly, here are our reasons for NVIDIA, as an example: 
* Beta = 1.38
* 7th largest US company, growing from 50th 2 years ago
* Average 57% revenue growth over last 8 quarters 
* Bought a couple days before their Q4 2021 earnings report was released on Feb 16th, which was expected (and achieved) to be their best quarter yet!

“We want to avoid the situation ... we want to go in the direction where peace is having a chance,” he said.

I'd like to better understand my own investments that I have made, that have so far been based on surface level news articles and analyst recommendations.

- For example, I'd like to understand the behavior of upstream versus downstream oil industries in different economic settings. What does Haliburton or Schlumberger do that Exxon does or does not? What exactly is the importance of liquefied natural gas and who is to benefit? How reliant will Japan be on future LNG shipping given its shutdown of nuclear energy?
- Or, understanding the relationship between AMD, INTC, TSMC, NVidia, ASML, etc. What is the significance of Gelsinger pushing for the manufacturing of these new 'fabs?' Is AMD or INTC really the leader and in what spaces? [Everyone here is always so one-sided on AMD vs INTC... which doesn't help me]
- Regarding the supply chain, I'm interested in the broader innovations that are to come in the future, if there are any. Will we get better at preventing future supply chain crises?

39,Time Travelling Companies?,"There are companies I have come across that seem to consistently report earnings for **future** **quarters**, rather than earnings for the quarter that has just past. At first I thought it might be a glitch, but it keeps happening quarter after quarter, and it's consistent across all financial news sites.

I understand that a company may have long-term contracts and be able to predict future revenue fairly well, but even if so I'm sure they can't accurately predict their expenses. All else aside, if a company if growing and having to raise funds there is no way they can predict interest rates for debt funding nor their future stock price for equity funding. This alone surely muddies the waters enough for reporting on future quarters to be an absurd practise. 

The main stock I've been following that does this is Digital Turbine. While most other companies have recently been reporting 2021 Q4 earnings, Digital Turbine just came out with 2022 Q3 earnings.

I'm still on the fence about the Genomic Bets but have positions in VRTX and REGN (who have other steady businesses and are collaborating with CRISPR and NTLA). 

[Here's](https://www.ft.com/content/4abf0f81-7e5a-4e93-8ccc-dbd23d5c88f3) the article and an excerpt: 


	""Wood is also a cheerleader for this emerging field of medical science, telling CNBC in December that three listed companies in the space — Intellia, Crispr Therapeutics and Editas — represent a “trillion dollar plus opportunity” (although in this instance she was talking about their potential combined market value, which stands at roughly $12bn, rather than revenue).

The CNBC interview, too, contained statements that could charitably be described as not quite right. Wood said “we have already seen functional cures for three blood-related diseases” in the gene editing space. No companies have secured regulatory approval for such treatments, nor are they expected to any time soon. Some very early success in clinical trials does not a cure make.

Wood said Intellia had recently “announced a functional cure” for ATTR amyloidosis, which she described as an “exotic blood disease”. ATTR is a protein misfolding disorder, not a blood disease, and the company is nowhere near announcing a cure for it. The trial data she referred to were derived from just six patients. Intellia is more cautious in its pronouncements and will only say its drug “could potentially be the first curative treatment” for the illness.

Wood’s breathless promotion of this exciting but unproved technology to her huge fan base helped fuel a biotech bubble in 2020 that burst spectacularly last year. Her Ark Genomic Revolution fund rode the surge in valuations but is down almost 60 per cent from its peak in February 2021 and registered roughly $2.5bn of outflows over the same period. Her flagship Ark Innovation fund, which also holds some gene editing stocks, has fallen by a similar amount.""",stocks,1645259224

68,Freedom Index weighed emerging market ETF: FRDM,"This ETF is compose of top 10 countries that, foremost, have the most freedom (Data from Fraser Institute, Cato Institute, and Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom) and are considered to be emerging markets. Such weighing removes less free countries relative to those that are more. This means China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, and others alike are outcompeted by those like Taiwan, Poland, and South Korea. The 10 countries currently weighed from most free to least are:  
 
1. Taiwan 22.69%  
2. Poland 16.58%  
3. South Korea 15.52%  
4. Chile 14.53%  
5. South Africa 7.77%  
6. Indonesia 6.78%  
7. Mexico 5.25%  
8. Philippines 4.95%  
9. Malaysia 4.00%  
10. Brazil 3.00% 
 
The reallocation according to freedom is done annually and the Freedom Score used for that is a proprietary algorithm. I believe in 2021, Poland was 1st, and India also had a spot on the list. From inception on 23 May 2019 to today 18 Feb 2022, it has gained 35.24%, underperforming the SPY by 18.67%, VT by 3.59%, and evened with VEQT. While not exceptional, it does match world index ETFs. 
 
However, when compared to other emerging market ETFs, FRDM has outperformed EEM, XEC, VEE, and ZEM by a range of 10.36% to 18.79%. The dips and rises among them are synced until Feb 2021. Where all emerging market ETFs are [experiencing falls since, FRDM is flattening](https://i.imgur.com/XkqLIvx.png). This is most likely due to tech crackdowns from the Chinese government.  
 
What about emerging market ETFs ex China? EMXC, XCEM, and KEMX all have none or greatly reduced China allocations according to MorningStar at 0.10%, 0.36%, and 0.00% respectively. However, they do include autocratic countries like Russia, Saudi Arabia, and currently Thailand. Their performance versus FRDM are in sync but does have [very slight under performance ranging from 1.99% to 4.34%](https://i.imgur.com/Y6wTIcb.png). I don't know if the inclusion of those countries had impact. Maybe Russian allocation such as 5% made them dip a bit.  
 
What's the theory behind this FRDM weighing? According to the Chinese-American Founder Perth Tolle, historically, countries with greater freedom, politically and socioeconomically, had greater economic growth also lower draw downs. This is found in developed markets' history, and all countries with those markets are ranked high in the Freedom Index. Without much distinction with each other in their level of freedom, the founder saw few opportunities to capture α. However, in emerging markets, their countries' freedom levels are all over the place. With difference in freedom, FRDM was created to bet on countries with more than those with less. This is the distinguishing feature of FRDM. Other emerging markets ETFs weighs all, or exclusively pluck China out due to that specific country's risk.  
 
The downside to this ETF is that I don't think it has competition. Therefore, its fee reflects it by charging twice than nearly other ETFs at 0.49%. The only other ETF that was higher was EEM, charging 0.68% for some reason, but that's an outlier.  
 
I am highly interested in purchasing this ETF with a significant allocation to my portfolio. I don't know any allocation theories to know how much yet. However, if there are world index ETFs that are also weighed in similar manners, I'll gladly buy that and abandon VEQT altogether because I don't want to invest my money to any autocratic countries.

# **Russia’s Ukraine threat and worries on Fed rate hikes could make for a turbulent week in markets - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/18/russias-ukraine-threat-worries-on-fed-rate-hikes-could-make-for-a-turbulent-week-in-markets.html)**
*****
&gt; The stock market faces another turbulent week, as investors watch the situation in Ukraine and continue to adjust portfolios ahead of the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Stocks were rocked in both directions in the past week, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average seeing its worst day of the year Thursday. The three major averages were lower for the week with the Dow off 1.9%, the Nasdaq down 1.7%, and the S&amp;P 500 down 1.6%. Energy, communications services and financials were the worst-performing sectors for the week.
*****
&gt; A few Fed speakers are on the calendar in the four-day week ahead, including Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Christopher Waller Thursday. Earnings continue to roll in, including reports from retailers Macy’s and Home Depot. There are also a number of economic reports, including durable goods, consumer spending and inflation data.
*****
&gt; “Maybe the biggest issue [for the market] next week is technical,” said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group.
*****
&gt; The market continued to fluctuate with developments surrounding Russia’s threat to invade Ukraine and its buildup of troops along the Ukraine border.
*****
&gt; “The problem with Russia, is what’s the end game? It could just go on forever … When you look ahead, the thing that’s going to change this is if they go in or there’s a total pullout, and what’s going to bring a pullout any time soon,” Paulsen said.
*****
&gt; He said stocks had looked set to break out higher before Russia’s threat against Ukraine started to weigh on the market. About two weeks ago, the S&amp;P 500 tried to retake 4,600 after touching a low of 4,222 on Jan. 24.
*****
&gt; “It was doing that despite all the Fed stuff and inflation. The market was OK with it. Russia brought it all down. Now you are in a situation where if we break low enough, we have to break that low,” said Paulsen.
*****
&gt; On Friday, Russia prepared to carry out more drills near Ukraine’s border, while the U.S. continued to press for a diplomatic solution. After the market close, President Joe Biden said he is convinced Russia has decided to attack in coming days.
*****
&gt; “As an investor, that leaves you hanging there, and technically you have to wonder if we’re going down to test that low,” said Paulsen. “I don’t know about the next 60 days, but the next six months should be good.”
*****
&gt; Chart analysis is not guaranteed to predict the path of the market, but many investors set their sights on key technical levels since so many investors react to them and algorithms are programmed around them. They also become a guide when fundamentals are very uncertain.
*****
&gt; # Watching the charts
Scott Redler, chief strategic officer at T3Live.com, watches the short-term technicals. He sees a good chance that the S&amp;P 500 revisits that January low in a retest. The S&amp;P 500 ended Friday at 4,348.
*****
&gt; “The narrative for this year is inflation, and the Fed removing accommodation. We may get a knee-jerk reaction on the Russia-Ukraine situation,” said Redler. He said even if the Russian threat fades, the market could still face volatility as the Fed moves to raise interest rates starting in March.
*****
&gt; “That doesn’t solve the problem of four to seven rate hikes this year and the runoff of the balance sheet,” he said, adding the market has responded negatively to Fed tightening in the past. “In 2018, the S&amp;P fell 20% and the Nasdaq fell 24%. So why wouldn’t the S&amp;P test the 4,222 area?”
*****
&gt; Redler and other technical analysts are watching a bearish pattern on the chart of the S&amp;P 500 that would suggest the index could form a “head-and-shoulders” pattern, which could bring even more volatility.
*****
&gt; “It’s a distribution pattern, which is what the market’s been doing over the past month as it builds the right shoulder,” said Redler. He said the neckline on the chart wou
*****
&gt; ld be around 4,220 to 4,280. “After it forms, you get lower prices if the neckline breaks.” In that case, he said the broad-market index could fall to 3,900, he added.
*****
&gt; Redler is also watching the charts of Big Tech stocks. “Apple has been an island where it’s not acting special, but it’s not breaking down. If Apple starts to break the 166-ish area, it would help to bring the S&amp;P down faster,” he said. “Apple’s been trying to hold the $165 to $170 area, which keeps it somewhat constructive.”
*****
&gt; Microsoft shares are also holding up. “Apple and Microsoft are such a high percentage of the S&amp;P and the Dow. In order for the bears to really growl, they’re going to have to break those two down, in addition to the high growth names,” he said.
*****
&gt; # Flight to safety
&gt; In the bond market, investors have been weighing Federal Reserve rate hikes against worries about a Russian invasion of Ukraine. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 1.93% Friday. Yields move opposite price. Investors have been looking to the 10-year as a safe haven against possible weekend developments in Ukraine.
*****
&gt; A week earlier, the market was anxious about the possibility the Fed would be more aggressive with interest rate hikes, starting with a possible 50-basis-point hike in March. But in the futures market, expectations for a half-point rate increase faded as the week wore on. The market was pricing in just about a quarter-point hike Friday.
*****
&gt; St. Louis Fed President James Bullard had raised expectations for a bigger hike, and he reiterated that view Monday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.” Then the minutes from the Fed’s last meeting were released Wednesday. They were less hawkish than expected, with no indication that the Federal Open Market Committee members favored a bigger rate hike.
*****
&gt; “I think based on what we heard from the minutes and everyone except for Bullard, it doesn’t seem anyone really favors a 50-basis point hike,” said Ben Jeffery, rates strategist at BMO Capital Markets.
*****
&gt; As for economic data in the coming week, there are a few important reports including durable goods and consumer sentiment Friday.
*****
&gt; Personal consumption expenditures data is also expected Friday. Investors will be focused on the inflation reading in that report, which is closely watched by the Federal Reserve.
*****
&gt; “We kind of have a pretty good guide that that’s going to come in ahead of expectations. It’s probably the highlight of the week, as far as the data goes,” said John Briggs of NatWest Markets.
*****
&gt; # Boiling oil
&gt; The tense situation with Moscow has driven oil prices higher because of concerns that any retaliatory sanctions from the U.S. could limit Russian oil on the market. West Texas Intermediate futures rose above $95 per barrel in the past week for the first time in seven years. But by Friday, the priced retreated to about $91.
*****
&gt; On Friday, the market reacted more to reports that the U.S. and Iran appeared close to a deal Friday to revive a nuclear agreement. If the deal is reinstated, Iran would be able to release its crude oil on to the global market.
*****
&gt; “There’s a lot of positive commentary around it. There seems to be a conclusion in the market. It’s a marriage of convenience. The market needs the barrels. The Biden administration needs the barrels, and the Iranians need the money,” said John Kilduff, partner with Again Capital.
*****
&gt; Kilduff said traders are watching the earnings reports from oil companies in the next week, with the most important being Occidental Petroleum. EOG Resources, NRG, Chesapeake Energy and Coterra Energy will also post results.
*****
&gt; With U.S. drilling rig counts increasing, Kilduff said investors are watching to see if companies report plans to increase drilling.
*****
&gt; “What are their capex plans going to be is a hot topic of conversation,” he said.

Over the most recent 21-year history this 15th trading of February has been down more than 60% of the time for S&amp;P 500 with average loss of -0.27% earning the day our “Angry Bear” icon.

&gt; Earlier this we noted the improving trend of market performance ahead of Presidents’ Day weekend. As you can see in the table here the days after has improved the past 10 years but the Wednesday after has not enjoyed the same turnaround and both days still display a fair amount of red. Since 1990, Tuesday after Presidents’ Day has been strongest for the S&amp;P 500 with 18 gains and 14 losses for median gain of 0.11% but with an average loss of –0.22%. DJIA also has more gains than losses on the Tuesday after, but NASDAQ is a net loser down 19 of 32 years with an average loss of –0.48% and a median loss of –0.21%.

&gt; Wednesday is all red for all three major averages. NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 have more losses, but DJIA has a larger average loss. On the Wednesday after the Presidents’ Day holiday DJIA is down 16 of 32 with an average loss of –0.06% and a median decline of –0.03%. S&amp;P 500 is down 19 of 32, average –0.02%, median –0.10% and NASDAQ is down 18 of 32, average –0.03%, median –0.14%.

&gt; # Diminishing Relative Strength For The US

&gt; In 2021 US equities, using the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) as a proxy, outperformed emerging markets (EEM) by 32.5 percentage points (ppts). That performance spread fell just short of 2013 when the performance spread was 35.4 percentage points (ppts). After 2013, SPY also outperformed EEM for each of the following three years by an average of 11.8% (median: 17.3%). Notably, we are currently on a streak of another four consecutive years of SPY outperforming EEM, which is tied with the period from 2013 through 2016 for the longest streak on record since EEM began trading in July of 2003. So far this year, SPY has traded down by 7.1% while EEM has gained 1.3%, thus resulting in a performance spread of 8.5 ppts.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/annual-performance-spy-vs-eem-021722-3.png))**

&gt; The start to 2022 has been tough for US equities relative to emerging markets, but what, if anything, does this mean for performance in the remainder of the year? Today (2/17) is the 33rd trading day of 2022, and since 2004, SPY actually only outperformed EEM at this point on a YTD basis 36.8% of the time. When EEM has outperformed SPY in the first 33 trading days of the year, the average rest of year performance spread has been -3.4 ppts (median: -5.6 ppts), meaning that EEM tends to continue outperforming for the rest of the year. While SPY tended to underperform, which one performed better for the remainder of the year was basically a coinflip as EEM only outperformed a little bit more than half of the time (54.5%). In terms of relative performance at this point in the year, 2022 ranks as one of the worst on record, second only to 2006 when SPY underperformed by 8.5 ppts. In 2006, EEM continued to outperform gaining 15.6% for the rest of the year compared to a 9.9% gain for SPY.

&gt; Since 2004, there have only been four years where SPY traded down from the close on the 33rd trading day of the year through year-end, and three of those occurrences were in years where SPY underperformed EEM in the first 33 trading days. When EEM outperforms SPY by over 4% in the first 33 trading days, the average rest of year performance for SPY has been a gain of 10.6% (median: 9.9%) and 10.0% (median: 15.6%) for EEM. Neither of these performance numbers differs all that much from the median rest of year returns in all years since 2004.

&gt; The chart below shows the relative strength of SPY vs EEM and European equities, as measured by the iShares Europe ETF (IEV) over the last six months where a rising line indicates outperformance of US stocks while a falling line indicates underperformance. Relative to both ETFs, US stocks are still outperforming over the last six months, but there was a clear shift in performance that began late in 2021, and both EEM and IEV are outperforming SPY.

&gt; Within the emerging markets group, Brazil (EWZ), South Africa (EZA), and Hong Kong (EWH) have been the strongest performers YTD, gaining 18.0%, 14.2%, and 6.0%, respectively. Of all of the countries we tracked that are classified as emerging markets, only one has underperformed the US YTD: Russia (ERUS). ERUS is down 8.2% YTD as the prospects of devastating sanctions from a potential invasion of Ukraine have been increasingly priced in.

&gt; # Revisiting the Biggest Winners and Losers Since the COVID Crash Low

&gt; In a little over a month on 3/23/22, we'll be exactly two years removed from the stock market's COVID Crash closing low. Below we show how the average stock that's currently in the S&amp;P 1500 has done since the 3/23/20 low by sector. Stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 are up an average of 155% since the COVID Crash low. By far the best performing sector has been Energy where the average stock is up 393%. Consumer Discretionary stocks are up the second most on average at +233.5%, while Materials stocks rank third with an average gain of 180.6%. Notably, stocks in the Financials and Technology sectors are both up roughly the same on average since 3/23/20 with gains of 148% and 145%, respectively. Three sectors have average gains of less than 100%: Consumer Staples (+94.4%), Communication Services (+89%), and Utilities (+42.9%). Note that these results are only based on price change, so higher dividend-paying sectors like Utilities are up more on a total return basis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/spxavg0215.png))**

&gt; There are currently 59 stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 up more than 500% from their closing level on 3/23/20, and there are 11 up more than 1,000%. GameStop (GME) remains at the top of the list with a gain of 3,042%, followed by SM Energy (SM) and Matador Resources (MTDR) with gains of more than 2,000%. Aluminum-maker Alcoa (AA) is the best performing Materials stock on the list with a gain of 1,160% since 3/23, rising from $5.67/share up to $71.45 as of this morning. The average share price of the 11 stocks that are up 1,000%+ was just $4.42 on 3/23/20. Their average share price now is $66.78!

&gt; Tesla (TSLA) is by far the largest company on the list of best performers with a market cap of more than $900 billion at the moment. Back on 3/23/20, Tesla (TSLA) shares closed at $86.86. Since then, the stock has gained 944%, putting shares above the $900 level.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/best-since.png))**

&gt; There are 56 stocks currently in the S&amp;P 1500 whose price today is lower than it was at the close on 3/23/20. Below are the 35 stocks that are down at least 10% in price since then. eHealth (EHTH) and Tabula Rasa (TRHC) have been the worst two with declines of more than 80%. Another three are down more than 50% (QURE, STRA, IVR), while 16 more are down 20%+. The two stocks on the list of worst performers with the largest markets caps at the moment are Gilead (GILD) and Biogen (BIIB). These two stocks performed well in the very early days of COVID, but they've been trending lower ever since and currently trade at the same levels they were at in mid to late 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/02/worst-since.png))**

&gt; Clorox (CLX) is an interesting name to see on the list of worst performers. When COVID first hit, there was a run on disinfectant products like bleach that Clorox manufactures. (Remember trying to find Clorox wipes throughout the first half of 2020? They were nowhere to be found!)

&gt; The supply/demand imbalance pushed shares of Clorox (CLX) sharply higher from January to August 2020, but since then shares have steadily trended lower and lower, and they're now right back to where they were trading in early January 2020. Normally, we see stocks ""take the stairs up and the elevator down,"" but the two-year chart for Clorox looks like the opposite: it took the elevator up when COVID first hit, and it has taken the stairs down ever since.

&gt; # How Many Seats Could The Democrats Lose In November?

&gt; One of the most popular questions we’ve received lately is what could happen in the upcoming midterm election? Although we are a long way away from Election Day, it is important to note that a new president has historically lost about 30 House seats in the midterm election. With the Democrats holding a historically small majority in the House currently, a swing this size would of course give the Republicans control.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.16.22-Blog-Chart-1.png))**

&gt; “Yes, history would say the Republicans likely gain control of the House and very well could gain the Senate as well,” explained LPL Financial Chief Market Strategist Ryan Detrick. “Coming into midterms the party that lost the presidential election is usually more motivated party, gaining close to 30 House seats going back to Woodrow Wilson in 1914.”

&gt; How does this all play out for your investments? We do expect Republicans to take the House right now, resulting in something close to a gridlocked Congress. What happens if Republicans take both the House and Senate? “The good news is one of the best scenarios for stocks is a Democratic President and Republican controlled Congress. In fact, the late 1990s saw that same scenario and it was one of the best times for investors ever,” added Detrick.

&gt; As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, a Republican controlled Congress with a Democratic President has been quite kind for investors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.16.22-Blog-Chart-2.png))**

&gt; One potential issue is President Biden’s low approval rating. With his current Gallup approval rating hovering near 40%, this extrapolates out to potentially losing 50 seats in the House. Thanks to our friends from Strategas Research Partners for help with this chart.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.16.22-Blog-Chart-3.png))**

&gt; But let’s remember the election is a long way off still and a lot could still happen. However Congress shapes up, there will be many checks and balances in place so what either party can do may be limited to areas where there’s bipartisan agreement.

&gt; Here are two more important midterm charts. First up, midterm years have seen the largest intra-year pullbacks, down more than 17% on average, but the S&amp;P 500 Index has gained more than 30% a year off those lows. In other words, don’t panic if we get some normal midterm volatility, it could be an opportunity for longer-term investors.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/2.16.22-Blog-Chart-4.png))**

&gt; Lastly, early in a midterm year stocks historically are quite weak. It isn’t until the election is over and the uncertainty is alleviated until a rally typically takes place. Every year is different, but maybe the weakness early in 2022 shouldn’t be a big surprise.

Naturally it will open the door to take on a lot more contracts, whether it be large private companies looking for more security or government contracts.

I've broken out two different groups below based around FCF Yield % and this years projected growth. 

FCF Yield % is personally one of my favorite metrics in investing and really grabs an idea for a companies internal profitability in respect to their enterprise value.

# Group 1: &gt;2.5% FCF Yield %

1. Meta Platform (FB) - 7.4%
2. Zoom (ZM) - 5.0%
3. Alphabet (GOOGL) - 4.1%
4. Nice (NICE) - 3.3%
5. Adobe (ADBE)  - 3.2%
6. Palo Alto Networks (PANW) - 2.9%
7. Microsoft (MSFT) - 2.8%
8. AutoDesk (ADSK) - 2.8%
9. Salesforce (CRM) - 2.7%
10. Workday (WDAY) - 2.6%

# Group 2: &gt;25% Projected 2022 Rev Growth + &gt;0.8% FCF Yield %

1. Expensify (EXFY) - 2.1%
2. ServiceNow (NOW) - 1.6%
3. Palantir (PLTR) - 1.5%
4. ZoomInfo (ZI) - 1.2%
5. JFrog (FROG) - 1.2%
6. Crowdstrike (CRWD) - 1.1%
7. Doximity (DOCS) - 1.1%
8. Zendesk (ZEN) - 1.1%
9. Atlassian (TEAM) - 1.1%
10. Semrush (SEMR) - 1.0%
11. HubSpot (HUBS) - 0.9%
12. The Trade Desk (TTD) - 0.9%

I personally think this is a great two groups to fish from depending on what you value more as an investor (growth vs relative value). You will have another opportunity to buy back your favorite story stock I promise you. 

Personally I'm eyeing Adobe, Alphabet, Palo Alto Networks, ServiceNow, Zendesk,  and HubSpot for my next buys (three from each group)

99,Odd question,[removed],stocks,1645227007
0,$DKNG + $ARKK - Cathie Woods has LOST IT!!,"I personally find it absolutely frightening the way the interview yesterday unfolded on CNBC with Cathie Woods. Valid counterpoints were made to her investment strategy that were basically undeniable, and she blew smoke and quoted statistics and tried to make it sounded like she was absolutely competent.

Cathie Woods getting into $HOOD has to be the ABSOLUTE bottom for her funds. That stock is an absolute dumpster fire, the worst stock I can think of owning (off the top of my head). $DKNG + $ROKU being the two latest dumpster fires she's hoarding. She's going on about her 5 year strategy (funds won't exist in 5 years I hope for everyone else's sake) while selling Twitter when she bought the position in Nov. '21.

I have five premises here:

1) Cathie Woods is NEVER wrong. Even when she's wrong, she's not actually wrong, the MARKET is wrong.

This reminds me of a person who buys a lottery ticket and claims it's the winning ticket, before the numbers come out. Well, the numbers finally do come out and not a single one match! Hah! You're wrong!! Well, the ticket holder digs in deeper, instead of acknowledging his failure, he instead says that the numbers are the winning numbers, however, the lottery draw was rigged. It will be investigated and the true winning numbers (on his ticket) will then be drawn, and he will be a millionaire. You have to understand there are people throughout history who will deny the truth until their death, creating their own alternate reality, and **these people are the most dangerous people of all.**

**Cathie Woods reminds me of a near perfect mirror image of Elizabeth Holmes with Theranos.** Elizabeth Holmes was extremely well spoken, and she absolutely never waivered publicly in regards to her thoughts on performance, the company, the future, etc. She had people believing against their better judgement because of how charismatic she was. **Avoid these people!**

2) She's a money grabber!! Look at that expense ratio!! .75!?! I could see that being justified if you took a yearly or monthly draw of .75 annualized based on total returns of the entire fund since the beginning, never taking draws when the funds are in a loss territory. You think she's going to do that? 

She's also STARTING NEW FUNDS!!! Her flagship fund has nothing but bagholders, and she wants to start NEW FUNDS! The gall!!!! She's cashing out on her image before it blows up in smoke. She'll be relaxing on a hand-built super-yacht, rest assured, when it's all said and done.

3) This follows a bit of #2, but she has absolutely no personal risk, except for the future income stream if her funds shrink into nothing. Her management fees are locked in whether you lose 99.999% of your money with her. It's her money, forever. Car salesmen are compensated on sales. They are paid if they successfully sell a car (make the fund above-market gains). The callousness of getting paid regardless of fund performance is to me, ruthless.

4) I remember, after losing quite a bit on the buy-button-removal fiasco with $HOOD related to $BB calls / $BB stock price being in the WSB discord telling people my story. The ones who actually believed I could have lost that much money decided they would fix me. ""Just invest in Cathie Woods $ARKK. She's the kingmaker! You just don't know what you're doing. She will carry you across the finish line."" Must have been 20 people in that chat room and all agreed.

However, I had a quick look at $ARKK's holdings and realized that at that time, February 2021, every stock she'd invested in had gone moon-shot and to make it worse, they all looked like pretty ridiculous stocks to me at the time. Well, after voicing my opinion, I was mocked heavily to the point I began to question my own decision making.

Point being is that someone who has so much charisma, is so well spoken and sounds knowledgeable (Elizabeth Holmes again) are ultimately the ones who convince others to drink the Cool-Aid. They stop thinking rationally about the investments; it becomes cult-like. Be extremely wary when people don't heed your counterpoints regarding stock trades; if they aren't open to obvious holes in their logic, they aren't thinking rationally.

5) Finally, she's a religious fanatic. Now, for full disclosure, I am a Christian as well (apologies for bringing up religion), however, she takes it to a dangerous level. I don't care how good my surgeon was, but if I was about to undergo surgery, and my surgeon said he's ""fulfilling the will of God"" by operating on me, I'd be off that table before he finished the sentence. She named her fund after the Ark of the Covenant. Have you guys read what happened to the priests who touched it to prevent it from falling to the ground?!

Money isn't created in a vacuum. In the stock market, there are winners and losers. If you win, someone else lost, for the most part. I don't necessarily want to get into M1 creation by FED pushing up money supply, etc, but basically, if your fund is beating inflation, you took the money from someone(s). How can that be the ""will of God."" Chuck, I know you're my best friend and all, but you have to give me your house and sign over the deed. It's the ""will of God."" God told me!

TL;DR: Be scared of Elizabeth Holmes #2, Cathie Woods. This won't end well.",stocks,1645226944

8,SpaceX to split its private stock 10-for-1,"Elon Musk’s SpaceX is splitting the value of its common stock 10-for-1, CNBC has learned, with the company’s valuation having soared to more than $100 billion.

The split means that for each share of SpaceX stock owned as of Thursday, a holder now has 10 shares after the conversion. With SpaceX valued at $560 a share during its most recent sale, the split reduces SpaceX’s common stock to $56 a share, according to a company-wide email obtained by CNBC.

“The split has no impact on the overall valuation of the company or on the overall value of your SpaceX holdings,” the email said.

SpaceX did not immediately respond to CNBC’s request for comment.

As the email to employees emphasizes, a stock split is cosmetic and does not fundamentally change anything about the company. Companies occasionally perform stock splits, such as high-growth tech companies such as Apple or Google-parent Alphabet, and the move is typically seen as a way to make the shares more accessible or manageable.

This is the first time SpaceX has performed a stock split, according to multiple people familiar with the private company.

The company’s valuation has soared in the last few years as SpaceX has raised billions to fund work on two capital-intensive projects: the next generation rocket Starship and its global satellite internet network Starlink.

18,Airbnb: 2021 provides best financial results in the company’s history,"#### 1. Key Highlights

Revenue: $1.53 billion +78% year-over-year (YoY)

Gross Profit: $1.24 billion +90% YoY

Net Income: $54.5 million compared to a loss of $3.89 billion YoY

#### 2. Wall Street Expectations

Revenue: $1.46 billion (beat by 5%)

Adjusted Earnings per Share: 0.03 (beat by 60%)

*Source:* [Zachs](https://www.zacks.com/stock/quote/ABNB/detailed-estimates)

#### 3. Business Activity

In Q4 2021, Nights and Experiences Booked of 73.4 million represented a significant increase of 59% YoY and slight a decrease of 3% compared to Q4 2019 levels. Continued strength in Nights and Experiences Booked in North America, EMEA and Latin America have driven significant YoY growth.

Strong recovery in Nights and Experiences Booked combined with higher Average Daily Rates (‘ADR’) drove over $11 billion of Gross Booking Value (‘GBV’) in Q4 2021. Both Q4 and FY 2021 saw significant increases in GBV from a year ago as well as from pre-COVID periods in 2019.

Nearly half of all nights booked in Q4 were for stays of a week or longer. One in five nights booked were for stays of a month or longer. In the past year alone, Airbnb guests stayed in about 100,000 towns and cities around the world, with nearly 175,000 of them booking stays for three months or longer.

#### 4. Income Statement

During the quarter, Airbnb grew its top line by 78% YoY. Gross profit is following a similar trajectory and increased by 90%, with gross margin also improving from 76% to 81% YoY. 

Operating expenses decreased by 69% to $1.16 billion during the quarter. The main driver here was product development expenses which decreased by 82% to $367 million. In Q4 2020, product development expenses included $1.81 billion related to stock-based compensation (SBC) from one-time IPO-related costs. Excluding the impact of SBC expenses, product development expenses increased 20% YoY.

The level of spending on sales and marketing expenses is an area I pay particular attention to. At one stage, Airbnb was spending 73% of its revenue on sales and marketing expenses alone. This was an anomaly in Q4 2020 as a result of one-time IPO-related SBC costs. Overall the trend is moving in the right direction and has decreased to 23% at Q4 2021.

26,Key language missing from bill banning congressional stock trading.,"I just read John Ossoff's bill banning congressional stock trading.  The bill is intended to prohibit trading in individual stocks, but does all trading in mutual funds and ETFs. There is an important type of investment missing from this bill, and that is important; unit investment trusts.

UITs have been around since 1940, and are an important way of investing.  They are focused, and targeted investments.  If this bill passes, there are some huge investments that will be banned.  Example? The S&amp;P 500 Spiders Trust ($SPY) is the biggest example.  While many call it an ETF, it is actually a UIT, with language in its prospectus for its eventual termination.

29,"Just curious, does anyone out there have a short position/puts on Apple? If so why and what does your position look like?","
Full disclaimer. I do not own a short position on Apple nor will I open one. This is not financial advice. 

I personally don’t have the strength to bet against the US economy nor its largest companies. I’ve held short positions in the past at certain moments of time, but I don’t have the mental fortitude to do so again. It’s tough business to do successfully and takes a lot of resolve. 

Here’s why I ask the question though. Apple is the largest corporation in the world at close to 3 trillion in market cap and represents close to 6% of the S&amp;P500. A broad based pull back or bear market would have to happen on the back of Apple. It’s chart is parabolic, P/E is trading at 30, much higher than it’s been able to sustain historically. That, and over 10-30 cycles, leaders in the S&amp;P tend to lost their standing over time. Think GE, Sears, Cisco, etc. Buffett often talks about how hard it is for the largest market cap corporations to sustain that position long term.

So it begs the question. Anyone out there shorting Apple? If so why and what does your position look like / how are you building your position?",stocks,1645212043

57,Sometimes the dip is the right time to sell.,"Buying the dip has one thing going for it: you're getting an asset for a lower price than it was recently trading for. It also has a downside that's not discussed very much - on these earnings moves, the market is reacting to actual financial data on these companies. By buying the dip, you're not only betting that the market is wrong, but that it'll admit it's wrong on your timeframe.

With that, I want to point out some famous recent dips, and how buying them may have worked out for you. There's definitely a possibility for confirmation bias here, but if you have good counterexamples, I'll be happy to add them to this list. The first column is how much the price gapped down between the close before earnings and the next open. The second column is the drop since that open.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

#Stock market faces the most ‘massive misallocation’ of ‘capital in the history of mankind,’ says ARK’s Cathie Wood

*Published: Feb. 17, 2022 at 1:51 p.m. ET
By Mark DeCambre*

&gt; Cathie Wood, the star fund manager and chief executive of ARK Invest, took to CNBC to defend the woeful performance of the manager’s suite of disruptive innovation funds.

&gt; Wood told the business network in a Thursday interview that the gravitation of money managers toward benchmarks, rather than taking risk on what she views as potentially game-changing technology in gene editing, electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, among others, was creating a “massive misallocation of capital” in markets that could be the biggest in “the history of mankind.”
“Benchmarks are where they are because of past successes…If we are right, those are the companies that will be disrupted,” she said on CNBC.  

&gt; She said “absolutely,” when asked if some of the companies her funds have invested in, which enjoyed nearly parabolic run-ups during the height of the pandemic-fueled worries in 2020, would return to their pandemic heights.

&gt; So far in 2022, each of the flagship ARK Innovation’s ARKK, -5.63% 40 holdings had fallen more than 10%. The fund itself has slumped 26% year to date, and lost more than half its value over the past 12 months, FactSet data show:

**[SEE CHART: https://archive.today/BXYwK]**

&gt; By comparison, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.49% was down 5% in the year to date, the S&amp;P 500 index SPX, -1.74% was trading 7.4% over the same period, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -2.30% has declined by 11.5% and the large-capitalization Nasdaq-100 index NDX, -2.30% was off 12.4%, as of Thursday afternoon.

&gt; Wood said the shares of all of the companies that ARK has bought in its various funds would return to lofty heights and trade well beyond their pandemic tops, including investments in companies such as Roblox Corp. RBLX, 0.85%, Teladoc Health TDOC, -3.38% and Zoom Video Communications ZM, -5.75%.

&gt; “We are not going back to the old ways of doing things,” she said about the surge in value in the cache of stocks bought by ARK that saw revenue accelerate during the COVID public health crisis.
She also made the case that mature growth companies, including those considered in the FAANG category, such as Meta Platforms FB, -2.71% (formerly known as Facebook Inc.), Apple Inc. AAPL, -1.82%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -1.17%, Netflix NFLX, -1.97% and Google-parent Alphabet GOOG, -2.70% GOOGL, -2.85%, would face bigger challenges, if interest rates rise and inflation pressures persist, than her disruptive innovative investments.

&gt; “The companies that are going to be hurt most by inflation and interest rates—if they are going to be a problem—are those that are in the mature growth category,” she said.

&gt; She reiterated that investors in ARK need to maintain a 5-year time horizon to eventually reap investment rewards.

&gt; “If we are right and the growth rate [is]15% on an annualized rate over the next five years, interest rates and inflation are not going to be a problem for,” ARK’s investments, she said.

&gt; To those who are betting on the failure of ARK, Wood said the idea of shorting innovation is “ridiculous,” referencing funds, including Tuttle Capital Short Innovation ETF SARK, 5.69%, which can be used to wager against ARK’s roster of investments.

&gt; “The idea of shorting innovation in America is ridiculous, I think,” she said.

&gt; “The pendulum has swung…and if we are right, the rewards are going to be enormous,” she said. (It is worth noting that Matthew Tuttle, CEO of Tuttle Capital, has said that his fund is geared toward those who want to take the other side of Wood’s bets as well those who are simply looking to protect against losses on such investments.)

&gt; Meanwhile, Wood also said that more than half of her personal net worth was tied up in ARK and its funds and that she feels the pain of investors who are suffering through current declines.",stocks,1645162920
13,Understanding the effects of inflation and interest rates on the valuation of stocks,"I've seen people say, ""stocks go down when interest rates go up"", and ""stocks go down when inflation goes up"".

Why would anyone or any investors bail out of stocks and hold cash or put money into bonds when it's a guaranteed loss, a slow steady burn down of purchasing power?

Also, high inflation has already happened, and it's going to continue to happen in some degree or another.  So, say a stock was valued at $100 prior to rapid inflation/devaluation of the dollar.  Why would people sell their shares for less than $100 when EVERYTHING else costs more?  I suppose when I think of time or assets, I'm continuously considering opportunity costs.  ""100 shares of XYZ is the equivalent of a new car.  I can trade these for a new car"".  If I socked away those share, made that investment with specific objectives in mind, as I think most people do the same (we're not saving and investing for the sake of seeing accruing numbers, we actually want to exchange those numbers for something real one day), anyhow, if I socked them away for a new car, and then the price of cars and everything goes up, I'm not selling those shares for LESS than what I paid, and even more so, I'm not selling them if I can't get that new car... or house... or retirement, etc.  In short, to me devaluation of dollars means I need more dollars for a car and anyone wanting my shares needs more dollars for them as well.  Is this irrational?  Why wouldn't inflation push up the price of stock in the same way it pushes up the price of everything else?",stocks,1645161989

* spending on Bank of America cards has jumped up to 20% from last year.
* While there was concern that consumer bank account balances would plunge after government stimulus programs ended, that hasn’t been the case yet, Moynihan said. Instead, balances have risen for the “last six or seven months,” according to the CEO.

What I don't understand is how is this possible. People are spending more than before. Government subsidies have decreased. And yet consumer bank accounts have actually gone up in the last six or seven months.

Also, if this trend continues -- people continue to increase spending -- doesn't that mean the Fed will have a near-impossible job to slow down inflation?

Obviously if the stock of the company drops by a lot that would dramatically impact my income. Is there a way I can ""insure"" myself against this risk? Would this be a place to buy puts against my employer? Any other ways of doing it? Is this worth it? Do people do it?

30,Shopify down another -12% after stock-price target gutted by analysts on slower growth,"Canadian e-commerce company Shopify Inc. had the average price target on its shares slashed to the lowest level since January 2021 after it signaled slower sales growth.

More than 20 analysts cut their targets after the stock plunged 17 per cent in Toronto on Wednesday, its biggest drop ever, following a company statement that full-year revenue growth will be lower than the 57 per cent increase in 2021. Shares extended losses Thursday, tumbling 11 per cent to the lowest since April 2020.

Shopify’s business surged during the pandemic, with sales jumping 86 per cent in 2020 as shoppers moved online. It became Canada’s most valuable company by market capitalization, overtaking Royal Bank of Canada. It surrendered that position in December amid a broader tech selloff, and as shoppers returned to brick-and-mortar stores.

Last month, Shopify said it had canceled warehouse and fulfillment-center contracts, pushing shares to a 16-month low. The company has tumbled almost 50 per cent this year, losing about $100 billion (US$79 billion) in market value. 

“The reality is that the above ‘in-line’ results combined with no firm outlook guidance was not enough,” National Bank analyst Richard Tse said in a note to clients. “If the above wasn’t enough to cause pause, a further notable fly in the ointment was a shift in the company’s SFN (fulfillment) strategy to own or run more of the major fulfillment hubs.”

Even as targets were gutted, analysts are largely positive on the stock: Shopify has only one sell rating, with 27 buys and 19 holds.

We see you have no prior trading experience, but don't worry, we've approved you to trade all sorts of derivatives! Wanna buy SPY options expiring next week? No problem buddy!

Oh hold on a second. You wanted to sell those options 60 seconds later for a 5% gain? OK well you can only do that two more times this week. However, if your willing to hold the derivatives overnight, feel free to do that as many times as you want! Yeah, cause holding overnight is totally less risky than being able to sell at any time.

PDT is obviously complete BS, because current rules and regulations allow for absolutely maniacal levels of risk, as evidenced by the loss porn on WSB. Any trader could turn $1,000,000 into $0 with minimal effort, so the idea that preventing traders with less than $25,000 in their accounts from aggressively scalping is somehow protecting them is laughable.

If protecting retail traders was truly the concern there would be much stricter rules around trading short-dated derivatives. 

Scalping can be a high probability strategy and all should be allowed to participate if they desire.

At a value of $565 billion, Facebook fell to the No. 11 spot, a ways behind Tencent Holdings at No. 10. During the fall, Meta has stumbled past companies including Tesla, Berkshire Hathaway, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor.

When it was Facebook, Meta had been among the top five or six most valuable companies in the world for the past few years.

Meta's now near a two-year low, at its lowest point since May 2020.

(inb4 go away stonkgod)

- $SST - System1, Inc is a[98.5% redemption deSPAC](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1805833/000119312522025942/d222372d8k.htm) only 700k float. Do you remember $ISPO running earlier today? Well $SST has a near identical setup with a HIGHER redemption rate and w/ options.

- The ENTIRE remaining float is captured by SI (1.39%) according to TD. 

- 97.8% of ENTIRE remaining float is captured by ITM OI (Feb-August calls). 45% of entire float is captured by 2/18 calls alone. How far ITM do you ask? Currently at $12.07 and $10c is the closest option down.

- The stock price hit $13.55 earlier today before going on a wild ride. $12.5c 2/18 alone accounts for another 600k+ shares. 

- Heavy bullish flow 2nd half of day and it only increased in the last hour, w/ $20k of big orders ranging from $2k-$3k on the $12.5c. (I’ll send pix of flow if you want).

- Other high redemption deSPACs ran HARD today but those are old news, don’t waste your money there. This thing is going to freakin blow

- u/repos39 posted the majority of info I used to become convicted in this play via [his twitter](https://twitter.com/repos_39?s=21)

42,Good companies you bought too high,"We all know that, by choosing our own stocks, we’re bound to make some of these mistakes. We research the company, we know they’re profitable and stable, but we end up paying too much for their stock. Which companies in your portfolio are you holding that you entered at too high of a price? I’ll start…

1) MMM - I grabbed 10 shares at around 178 after it came down from 200 alongside AMGN and JNJ. Of the three purchased at the time, only MMM hasn’t printed. It’s a “forever” hold for me, but man, why did I think the high 170s was a decent price?

2) DIS - Bought on my first day in the market back in April of 2021. I had no clue how to value stocks at the time, and I grabbed them at 187. It’s only returned to that price once since then (August earnings beat), but otherwise it’s a permanent red mark.

3) INTC - Same as Disney. Day one purchase, just happened to buy when it was at 67. Have since added more at 47 to bring my average down, but wow, why the rush to buy?

4) CI - Not a day one buy, but I bought based on its up trending chart, hoping to continue riding the wave. Little did I know my 259 entry would be near the top of the wave, because CI since then dipped as far down as the high 190s.

5) RIO - Lured in by its dividends, I happened to buy at 90 when commodity prices were near their peak. It climbed to 97 before quickly tumbling into the 60s. It’s climbing again though, but I need to sell it and buy back in when commodities drop again.

44,Roku plunges -22% on disappointing revenue and guidance,"Roku shares fell as much as 20% in extended trading on Thursday after the video-streaming company issued fourth-quarter revenue and first-quarter revenue guidance that came in below consensus.

Here’s how the company did:

Earnings: 17 cents per share, adjusted, vs. 9 cents per share as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
Revenue: $865.3 million, vs. $894.0 million as expected by analysts, according to Refinitiv.
Revenue grew by 33% year over year in the quarter, according to a letter to shareholders, compared with 51% growth in the third quarter and 81% in the second quarter.

With respect to guidance, Roku called for $720 million in first-quarter revenue, which implies 25% revenue growth. The Refinitiv revenue consensus was $748.5 million. Roku said it sees $55 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, in the first quarter, below the $79.2 million consensus among analysts polled by FactSet.

Roku expects revenue growth in the mid-30s percentage range for all of 2022, Steve Louden, the company’s finance chief, said on a conference call with analysts. Analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected 36% growth. Louden said the company sees EBITDA would be consistent with 2020, when it was $150.0 million.

Not long after the announcement, Roku was trading at its lowest point since June 2020. During Thursday’s trading session, in which the S&amp;P 500 index fell 2%, Roku’s stock had gone down 10%. Setting aside the after-hours move, Roku stock has fallen about 37% since the start of 2022, while the S&amp;P was down about 8% over the same period.

Management attributed the slower growth to supply shortages that hurt the U.S. market for televisions.

“Similar to Q3, overall U.S. TV unit sales in Q4 fell below pre-COVID 2019 levels,” Anthony Wood, Roku’s founder and CEO, and Steve Louden, its finance chief, wrote in the letter. “Some of our Roku TV OEM partners were hit particularly hard with inventory challenges, which negatively impacted their unit sales figures and market share in Q4.”

The company chose not to pass on higher material and shipping costs in order to benefit user acquisition.

“While we expect market conditions to result in player-related costs remaining elevated for the near term, we do not believe these conditions will be permanent,” Wood and Louden wrote.

Roku reported 60.1 million active accounts in the fourth quarter. That figure was up 17% year over and year and more than the 59.5 million that analysts polled by StreetAccount had been looking for. The number of hours each active account watched declined year over year.

In the fourth quarter, the company’s Platform segment, which includes digital advertising subscription and revenue sharing and sales of branded buttons on remote controls, generated $703.6 million in revenue, up 49% and lower than the StreetAccount consensus of $732.2 million. Platform revenue had grown 82% in the third quarter. The segment’s gross margin came in at 60.5%, narrowing from 65.0% in the third quarter.

Automotive and consumer packaged goods companies endured their own supply challenges, which resulted in light advertising spend, Wood and Louden wrote.

Player revenue, from sales of streaming players and audio devices, totaled $161.7 million, declining 9% as analysts surveyed by StreetAccount had expected $162.5 million.

In the quarter Roku said it had completed an agreement with Google to keep YouTube and YouTube TV on its service.

In other words what I want is **what category of entity** is buying &amp; selling equities and options each day.

And in a world where stock markets are made up of people with strong emotional control and whom investments are the result of a careful and thorough due diligence, that expression might even make sense. But that's not our world is it?

In fact, the reasoning process of the average investor is not ""I valued AMD at $70 per share but with this new information available, the intrinsic value lowers to $60"", instead, it's something more like ""Bad news for AMD, must sell before it's too late"" or ""Bad news for AMD, what do you think guys, should I sell?"".

Stock prices go where the relationship between bid and ask makes them go, there is no logic adjustment based on the impact new information is going to have. When the stock market moves downward following bad news, chances are (100%, to be precise) it will continue to do so for as long as the amount of investors who wants to close their positions at all costs will outweight all the others.

Then there’s the competitive edge: how much does it have over brands like Nestle in food or PG in household products?

If this scenario was you, what would you do?

- Still holding some **crappy** stocks that are down 50-70%.. Don't think they're allowed to be named here.
- Still holding some **okay** stocks that are down 40-70%.. PYPL, DKNG
- Sold some others at a loss such as BABA
- Holding some good stocks that are down 20-40%.. which I'll hang on to for the long hall
- Put a good portion into your typical VTI/VOO as well as stuff like MSFT, AAPL so I'm only down 13% overall for my entire portfolio (excluding retirement). So it could have been worse.
- Stupidly still have 11k in margin at 3%, which was fine when everything was booming, not it's not good. Yes, I learned my lesson there.

1,Dow drops over 400 points as Biden warns Russia invasion of Ukraine could come in next ‘several days’,"U.S. stocks fell Thursday, as investors dealt with renewed fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine as the U.S. and its allies accused Moscow of continuing to build up troop levels. 

Markets were whipsawed by Ukraine-Russia headlines, with NATO accusing Moscow of misleading the world over troop withdrawals, saying that country had instead moved in about 7,000 additional soldiers, though Russia still claimed it was withdrawing troops. 

Also, Russian-backed separatists in Ukraine have accused government forces of opening fire on them. The U.S. and its allies have accused Russia of planning to use false reports of attacks on separatists as a pretext for an invasion. The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Russia has filed a report with the United Nations alleging that Ukraine’s military has committed “crimes” against residents of the eastern Donbas region. 

“This is likely to be the bigger concern for NATO and the U.S., if separatist forces try and goad Ukrainian forces into a counter-response, thus creating an excuse for a Russian incursion, and for all hell to break loose,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note.

“The bigger risk for markets is that President Putin simply leaves the bulk of his forces on the border and simply plays a game of cat and mouse for the next few weeks and months,” Hewson said.

I've made decent money mostly off of $MU and $MSFT, partially due to the obscene bull market we've been going through. My sentiment was to avoid timing the market, as people online often advise. Here's the story of me being an idiot, losing a ton of money and learning a valuable lesson.

I've been invested in $CTXR since 2020. Had an amazing average price, made a lot of money selling it last year, when it peaked, and kept buying until recently. Last week, I owned 1000 shares (which, for a broke Greek university student, is a lot) and I was feeling happy with my investment.

Then, in a divine epiphany, my dumbass decided that I was going to time the market. Both the rising inflation and the tension in Ukraine made me believe the market would overreact downwards. So... I decided to close **my entire position.** I made a quick buck and assured myself I would buy back in on Monday, for a better price would occur.

Well, as one would imagine by the attitude of this post, $CTXR is 20% up since last Friday. I missed on hundreds of dollars of gains, and now it will be borderline impossible to buy in as low as my original position was.

I literally do not know what got into me, but I feel like an utter idiot, and my mood is on the floor. Be smart. Don't be like me.",stocks,1645114448

Building upon the acquisition of Scalyr, DataSet expands beyond cybersecurity use cases delivering a limitless enterprise data platform for live data queries, analytics, insights, and retention.

Asana, Copart, TomTom, and DoorDash selected DataSet to analyze all types of data from an unbounded time horizon – streaming and historical. CTOs, CIOs, engineering, and IT operations teams select DataSet, replacing Elastic and Splunk, to harness the power of their data.

With the launch, SentinelOne (NYSE: S)  has appointed Rahul Ravulur to lead DataSet. He brings more than 25 years of experience in building and operating enterprise products at scale, most recently leading product at Splunk. 

DataSet website is live and lists solution sections for:

\- Full-Stack Log Analytics

\- Data Lakes

\- ELK Replacement

\- Custom Data Solutions

This was huge news released yesterday. This was a small M&amp;A deal SentinelOne did before going public last year for 100M, similar to Crowdstrike and Humio, but this is the full integration rollout just about a year later. 

This is unlocking an immense amount of TAM and use cases in just one press release with Data Lakes (think Apache, Databricks), Log Analytics (Splunk, Dynatrace), ELK Replacements (Elastic). Will be very interested to hear management discuss this when they report earnings next month

As I understand they have missed several earnings and didn't meet expectations in growth while Cloudlflare exceeded. 

Yesterday, Fastly published the earnings for Q4/21 and, according to their web page, increased their revenue by 13%. However the stock got beat down heavily right after earnings.

40,Why own Gold?,"From Global Investing

-	No other financial or physical asset has been as reliable a store of value over long periods of time as gold
-	Gold and Silver were money for centuries
-	Over long periods of time, gold and silver have had real returns near zero
  - But the effectiveness as a long-term inflation hedge and insurance against economic and political upheavals, make them worthy of inclusion
-	If gold has a real expected return of 0%, why hold it?
  - Insurance against catastrophic changes such as economic collapse or hyperinflation.
  - Gold and Silver tend to become money during periods of crisis.
  - Gold and Silver tend to be inflation hedges, but not perfectly reliable ones.
  - Gold and Silver has low correlations with other assets making them a powerful diversification tool to reduce portfolio risk
    - When traditional assets perform poorly, gold fares well
    - Silver tracks gold, but has had a higher correlation to other assets and is thus not as good a diversifier as gold
-	In 1960, gold accounted for 3.7% of investable global assets.
-	By 1980, (when metal prices peaked) Gold and Silver made up 14% of the world&amp;#39;s investable assets
-	By 1990, as stock and bond prices soared, that had dropped to 3%
-	The silver market is very thin compared to gold
-	Commodities futures have low correlations with other assets.
  - Commodities and bonds tend to act opposite each other
    - Why? Commodity futures are claims to real assets, while bonds are claims to money payments
-	Gold was more volatile than commodity futures but had a better return.

From Devil Take the Hindmost

-	When governments find their formal currency arrangements disintegrating, the speculator becomes a convenient scapegoat
-	Nixon suspended the convertibility of the dollar to gold on August 15, 1971
-	Whenever speculation got out of hand and a financial crisis appeared, everyone seeks refuge in the precious metal Gold. Gold represents the antithesis of speculative values
-	The best hedge against the chronic inflation of the period could be found in commodities and precious metals

From 4 Pillars

-	PM funds have low expected return. But they are almost perfectly uncorrelated with the market and during global market meltdown, they are likely to do well. PM are also a hedge against inflation. But be careful with PM. Because you will be going against the market and you need to rebalance during. You will be selling when everyone on TV is saying to BUY and you will be buying when everything is good and people will tell you how dumb that is.
-	PM, REIT&amp;#39;s, Emerging Market, Small Cap International bring more to the table than the returns would suggest IF YOU REBALANCE!!!! YOU HAVE TO REBALANCE THESE FUNDS

50,A buyout is occurring at BCRX,"A buyout is brewing at biocryst

Stop me if you’ve heard this line before “ such and such company is a prime buyout candidate”…this is normally the part where I leave the chat. No…nobody is swooping in and buying $SRNE for $100 share Karen. Stop it.

Such is life in biotech investing, everyone is hunting for that buyout and few rarely get it. Which is why I’ve never written a statement like this in my life but the current events are SO PAINFULLY obvious that it needs to be said. Somebody is buying biocryst pharmaceuticals. Like right now..likely the deal is already done. What we are witnessing currently is a very common event in bio techs where the figure being paid doesn’t match the current the value of the share price (because bio’s are shorted and manipulated to hell)  so the buyer is running up the share price like nobodies business so that by the time the BO is announced nobody dings them to much on the valuation. Seriously…that’s happening right now. BCRX shares are running faster than Usian bolt. Inflation? green. Fed said something stupid? green. The entire market and especially bio tech is getting absolutely pummeled worse than Connor Mcregor in his last 2 fights? GREEN GREEN GREEN. Day after day after day bcrx has been achieving new high after new high and as of this current writing is sitting at the highest price the stock has been in the last 20 years during one of the most volatile stretches of market for absolutely NO KNOWN REASON. Nothing. It’s just doing it. That’s because it’s part of the plan. I just checked my ticker…it’s up even more as I am writing this. 

The last 30 days have been extremely volatile. The Nasdaq (which bcrx trades on) is down 5%, the XBI which tracks bio tech as a whole, is flat. BCRX meanwhile is up 36% and continuing to climb. Every. Single. Day. 

Now…this wouldn’t be weird if it was tied to something. Some crazy news…a new trial etc but absolutely nothing has occurred. BCRX has long been known as the most undervalued stock on wall street. In fact an article on reddit donned that name and it went viral making it’s way all the way to MSNBC and others. This is for very good reason…BCRX recently just finished it’s first year of sales of it’s blockbuster drug Orladeyo. For years the street undervalued the hell out of it and said it wouldn’t do more than 20m in it’s first year. What did they do? Not much…just the most successful small cap drug launch of the year…during a pandemic…for a very rare disease. Year 1 sales came in at 120m, expected to eclipse 250m this year and a newly set peak sales volume set at ONE BILLION DOLLARS. Pretty far off from 20 but ok.

Orladeyo alone should have the companies share price creeping around 35-40/share so even at the current $19 price there’s a ton of value still here. However…nothing even comes close to the insane, world changing, stupid money blockbuster BCRX has slowly been progressing and releasing absolutely gangbuster data on. I’m talking of course about bcrx 9930.

Listen, I’ve typed too much to geek out on 9930 so I’m just going to make this simple. Look up alexion..Alexion recently sold for 40B$ to AZ. Here’s the thing…Alexion essentially has 1 drug…seriously ONE DRUG FOR 40 BILION DOLLARS. Now, I’m being a little hyperbolic. They have a couple version of the same drug under different names and such but they essentially have one thing, a factor D inhibitor. It’s a good drug. Factor D inhibition has the ability to treat and cure a plethora of compliment mediated diseases. It was grossing 10’s of billions of dollars a year for them. The issue is it’s a painful injectable that needs to be administered by doctors and patients need to have regular transfusions at transfusion centers. 

Ready for the kicker? BCRX has the same thing but…it’s a pill. Seriously a freaking pill and here’s the best part…..IT WORKS BETTER. Legitimately. No doubt about it better. The data has been absolutely staggering showing just how much better this one little pill treats all these patients over Alexion’s injectable. So much so that the FDA literally okayed them skipping a phase 2 trial and going right to their final pivotal study before filling for approval. That’s happening right now. At the end of this trial (roughly 26-52 weeks) they will be applying to bring this absolutely staggering blockbuster drug to the market and will instantly become one of the most powerful organizations in the pharmaceutical industry.

Unless someone buys them first….and they did. It’s done…Just look at the share price. For the record I am up nearly 500% on my biocryst investment. (If you don’t believe me I’ll post receipts) and I am not selling a single share. Why would I sell before a buyout?

Which is why I’ve never written a statement like this in my life but the current events are SO PAINFULLY GOD DAMN OBVIOUS that it needs to be said. Somebody is buying biocryst pharmaceuticals. Like right now..likely the deal is already done. What we are witnessing currently is a very common event in bio techs where the figure being paid doesn’t match the current the value of the share price (because bio’s are shorted and manipulated to hell)  so the buyer is running up the share price like nobodies business so that by the time the BO is announced nobody dings them to much on the valuation. Seriously…that’s happening right now. BCRX shares are running faster than Usian bolt. Inflation? Fuck you, green. Fed said something stupid? Fuck you, green. The entire market and especially bio tech is getting absolutely pummeled worse than Connor Mcregor in his last 2 fights? Fuck you, GREEN GREEN GREEN. Day after day after day bcrx has been achieving new high after new high and as of this current writing is sitting at the highest price the stock has been in the last 20 years during one of the most volatile stretches of market for absolutely NO KNOWN REASON. Nothing. It’s just doing it. That’s because it’s part of the plan. I just checked my ticker…it’s up even more as I am writing this. 

The last 30 days have been extremely volatile. The Nasdaq (which bcrx trades on) is down 5%, the XBI which tracks bio tech as a whole, is flat. BCRX meanwhile is up 36% and continuing to climb. Every. Single. Day. 

Now…this wouldn’t be weird if it was tied to something. Some crazy news…a new trial etc but absolutely nothing has occurred. BCRX has long been known as the most undervalued stock on wall street. In fact an article on reddit donned that name and it went viral making it’s way all the way to MSNBC and others. This is for very good reason…BCRX recently just finished it’s first year of sales of it’s blockbuster drug Orladeyo. For years the street undervalued the hell out of it and said it wouldn’t do more than 20m in it’s first year. What did they do? Not much…just the most successful small cap drug launch of the year…during a pandemic…for a very rare disease. Year 1 sales came in at 120m, expected to eclipse 250m this year and a newly set peak sales volume set at ONE BILLION DOLLARS. Pretty far off from 20 but ok.

Orladeyo alone should have the companies share price creeping around 35-40/share so even at the current $19 price there’s a ton of value still here. However…nothing even comes close to the insane, world changing, stupid money blockbuster BCRX has slowly been progressing and releasing absolutely gangbuster data on. I’m talking of course about bcrx 9930.

Listen, I’ve typed too much to geek out on 9930 so I’m just going to make this simple. Look up alexion..Alexion recently sold for 40B$ to AZ. Here’s the thing…Alexion essentially has 1 drug…seriously ONE DRUG FOR 40 BILION DOLLARS. Now, I’m being a little hyperbolic. They have a couple version of the same drug under different names and such but they essentially have one thing, a factor D inhibitor. It’s a good drug. Factor D inhibition has the ability to treat and cure a plethora of compliment mediated diseases. It was grossing 10’s of billions of dollars a year for them. The issue is it’s a painful injectable that needs to be administered by doctors and patients need to have regular transfusions at transfusion centers. 

Ready for the kicker? BCRX has the same thing but…it’s a pill. Seriously a freaking pill and here’s the best part…..IT WORKS BETTER. Legitimately. No doubt about it better. The data has been absolutely staggering showing just how much better this one little pill treats all these patients over Alexion’s injectable. So much so that the FDA literally okayed them skipping a phase 2 trial and going right to their final pivotal study before filling for approval. That’s happening right now. At the end of this trial (roughly 26-52 weeks) they will be applying to bring this absolutely staggering blockbuster drug to the market and will instantly become one of the most powerful organizations in the pharmaceutical industry.

Unless someone buys them first….and they did. It’s done…Just look at the share price. For the record I am up nearly 500% on my biocryst investment. (If you don’t believe me I’ll post receipts) and I am not selling a single share. Why would I sell before a buyout?

&gt;**September 17, 2008: ""SEC puts 'naked' short sellers on notice: Regulator enacts new ruling banning 'naked' short selling on ALL PUBLIC COMPANIES"" (all-caps emphasis my own) By David Ellis,** **CNNMoney.com** **staff writer**  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a set of new rules Wednesday which would ultimately ban the practice of so-called ""naked"" short selling, possibly providing some much-needed comfort for financial markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;But instead of just shielding the embattled financial services industry this time around, the nation's securities regulator said the prohibition would cover all publicly traded companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;""These several actions today make it crystal clear that the SEC has zero tolerance for abusive naked short selling,"" SEC Chairman Christopher Cox said in a statement.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Traditional short sellers borrow stock with the aim of selling it, then buying it back at a lower price, hoping to pocket the difference. In a ""naked"" short sale, however, investors short the stock without actually borrowing it, making it much easier to drive down the share price of a company.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Dramatic swings**  
&gt;  
&gt;Some market observers have blamed the recent wild swings in financial markets and steep decline in financial stocks on the practice of ""naked"" short selling. Hoping to stem the sharp selloff that the industry endured back in early July, the SEC enacted a temporary ban on the practice for 17 domestic and international securities firms, along with the twin mortgage giants Freddie Mac ([FRE](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FRE&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/3018.html?source=story_f500_link)) and Fannie Mae ([FNM](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=FNM&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/2434.html?source=story_f500_link)).  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;The move helped, but financial stocks have come under pressure once again following the dramatic events over the last three days, including the collapse of Lehman Brothers ([LEH](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=LEH&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/10312.html?source=story_f500_link)), the purchase of Merrill Lynch ([MER](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MER&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/2487.html?source=story_f500_link)) by Bank of America ([BAC](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=BAC&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/2580.html?source=story_f500_link)) and a government rescue of insurer AIG ([AIG](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AIG&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/ZFCDT/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/2469.html?source=story_f500_link)).  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Prior to Wednesday's announcement, industry groups like the American Bankers Association feared that the yet-to-be-announced rules may not go far enough to protect the stock price of banks.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Other groups, like the Managed Funds Association and the Coalition of Private Investment Companies, which represent hedge funds and other asset managers, have opposed any permanent changes, fearing that a rule would not only limit legitimate short selling but also give an inaccurate representation of the real price of a stock.

&gt;**""SEC bans short-selling: Agency puts temporary halt to trading practice that 'THREATENS INVESTORS AND CAPITAL MARKETS' for 799 financial companies"" (all-caps emphasis my own) By David Goldman,** **CNNMoney.com** **staff writer**  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) -- The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission took what it called ""emergency action"" Friday and temporarily banned investors from short-selling 799 financial companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;The temporary ban, aimed at helping restore falling stock prices that have shattered confidence in the financial markets, takes effect immediately.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;""This will absolutely make a difference,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economists at Avalon Partners. ""Short sellers are going to have to cover their positions very heavily.""  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Short sellers borrow stock with the aim of selling it, then buy it back at a lower price, hoping to pocket the difference. The commission said short sellers add liquidity to the markets during normal conditions, but recent unbridled short-selling has contributed to the recent tailspin in the stock market.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;""The commission is committed to using every weapon in its arsenal to combat market manipulation that threatens investors and capital markets,"" said SEC Chairman Christopher Cox in a statement. ""The emergency order temporarily banning short selling of financial stocks will restore equilibrium to markets.""  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Cox said the action ""would not be necessary in a well-functioning market,"" and is just one of many actions being taken by the government to jump-start the embattled financial markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;The SEC also said it would temporarily ease restrictions on companies' ability to repurchase their stock, and force money managers to report their short positions in certain stocks that are not included in the 799 banned companies.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Some market observers have also blamed short sellers for the punishing declines in bank stock prices over the past few days. Critics of short sellers have argued that some had been spreading rumors about a company while ""shorting"" the stock in order to drive the price lower.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;""In the marketplace, we need both sides of the equation,"" Cardillo said. ""But the relaxed regulation of the SEC has led to abuses of short selling that have destroyed many, many companies.""  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;As panic began to permeate the financial markets, many investors took short positions on already battered financial companies regardless of the news that came out of the companies or the government. For instance, investment banks Morgan Stanley ([MS](https://archive.ph/o/Dmnzc/https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MS&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/Dmnzc/https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/3515.html?source=story_f500_link)) and Goldman Sachs ([GS](https://archive.ph/o/Dmnzc/https://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GS&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/Dmnzc/https://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/10777.html?source=story_f500_link)) reported better-than-expected earnings Wednesday, but dropped significantly in trading.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;""This decision will squeeze the shorts,"" Cardillo added. ""Now, if there is any good news, shorts will have to cover.""  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;The ruling comes after the SEC decided Wednesday [to ban](https://archive.ph/o/Dmnzc/https://money.cnn.com/2008/09/17/news/companies/sec_short_selling/index.htm?postversion=2008091711) the practice of so-called ""naked"" short-selling, in which investors short the stock without actually borrowing it.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;On Thursday, Britain's Financial Services Authority also temporarily banned short-selling for financial companies. The SEC said it is consulting the FSA in the matter.

&gt;**""The end of Wall Street: As Lehman's demise and Merrill's acquisition make clear, A BUSINESS MODEL BUILT ON RAMPING UP RISK AND LEVERAGE SIMPLY DOESN'T WORK."" (all-caps emphasis my own) By Shawn Tully,** **CNNMoney.com** **editor at large**  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;NEW YORK (Fortune) -- Rumor has it that Lehman Brothers CEO Dick Fuld recently wanted to turn off the firm's signature Jumbotron, the giant panels that flash the Lehman name day and night at its headquarters in New York's theater district.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Running the lights, the story goes, was costing Lehman ([LEH](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=LEH&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/10312.html?source=story_f500_link)) $500,000 a year. But New York City rejected Fuld's plea, since buildings in the Times Square area are required to keep their facades aglow to create the arcade effect that dazzles the tourists.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;The lights are still on at Lehman HQ, but they're going out both for the 158-year old firm and for the Wall Street business model that it represents.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Now that Lehman has declared bankruptcy, and Bank of America is buying Merrill Lynch for $50 billion, the ranks of Wall Street survivors have shrunk in the space of six months from five to two, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;With Merrill, and Bear Stearns before it, being acquired by giant commercial banks, we're witnessing the triumph of the diversified, universal banking model over the Wall Street one that focused on trading securities and advising corporate clients.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Eventually, the trend will probably capture Morgan Stanley and Goldman as well. Even if they skirt the fate of their former peers, their time is past.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;The demise of old Wall Street isn't just about bad bets on mortgages or the hubris of Dick Fuld. It's the failure of an antiquated, risky strategy that depended on macroeconomic luck and that grossly overcompensated employees for being in the right place at the right time.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Debt and more debt**  
&gt;  
&gt;The game Wall Street played relied on leveraging up the cash provided by shareholders to enormous levels and using all the debt to accumulate a giant portfolio of securities.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;As long as interest rates trend downward, the value of that portfolio swells, yielding gigantic returns on a slim equity base. And, with the exception of a few scary blips caused by the Asian currency crisis and the tech meltdown, that's what happened for most of Lehman's existence since it was spun off by American Express ([AXP](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=AXP&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/2493.html?source=story_f500_link)) in 1994.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Based on a huge surge in profits, the employees arrange to take compensation in amounts unheard of outside of sports and Hollywood.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;This model has an obvious, and fatal, flaw. Earnings on Wall Street no longer come chiefly from recurring businesses but rather from a combination of huge leverage and huge risk. When good luck turns, as it did in the credit crisis that began just over a year ago, the shareholder wealth supporting all that leverage gets wiped out.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;That's precisely what happened at Lehman. Its shares are trading today at around 20 cents, meaning that outside of the dividend that the firm slashed last week, Lehman managed to destroy wealth for shareholders. The employees, though, took out tens of billions in excess pay that's parked in mansions, yachts and stock portfolios.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;How did such a scenario come to pass? There are four key reasons:  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Too much leverage**  
&gt;  
&gt;Between 2004 and 2007, Lehman swelled its balance sheet by almost $300 billion through the purchase of securities often backed by residential and commercial real estate loans. But in the same period, the firm added a miniscule $6 billion in equity.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;As a result, assets jumped from an already high level of 24 times capital, to 31 times. So if the total value of the portfolio declined by 3% or so, shareholders' equity would be erased.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Ever riskier products**  
&gt;  
&gt;Over the years, once-lucrative businesses on Wall Street have become commoditized, including trading and underwriting bonds for clients.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;So Lehman, along with Merrill Lynch ([MER](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MER&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/2487.html?source=story_f500_link)) and other firms, pushed into higher-margin products, notably the packaging and trading of ever more exotic types of mortgage-backed securities. This allowed Lehman and others to keep profits humming. But the shift radically changed their businesses.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wall Street became far more dependent on proprietary trading and far less reliant on clients. Before the collapse of Bear Stearns, it along with Lehman, Merrill, Morgan Stanley ([MS](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MS&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/3515.html?source=story_f500_link)) and Goldman Sachs ([GS](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=GS&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/10777.html?source=story_f500_link)) derived over 60% of revenues from trading, most of it for their own accounts, versus around 40% in the late 1990s.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Wall Street firms evolved into giant hedge funds. Now they're suffering the same fate as a lot of over-leveraged hedgies.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Big bets, short-term debts**  
&gt;  
&gt;Unlike Bank of America ([BAC](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=BAC&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/2580.html?source=story_f500_link)) or JPMorgan Chase ([JPM](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=JPM&amp;source=story_quote_link), [Fortune 500](https://archive.ph/o/qWHah/money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500/2008/snapshots/2608.html?source=story_f500_link)), Lehman and the other independent investment banks don't have a stable base of retail deposits to use for buying securities.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Instead, they rely on short-term debt that needs to be constantly refinanced. That's fine as long as the mortgages and other securities they hold are stable or rising in value and thus easy to sell. But when real estate started to slump, Lehman and its brethren couldn't sell securities they owned except at a big loss.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;In the case of Bear, creditors got so nervous about lending money for securities that couldn't be sold that they refused to roll over Bear's commercial paper.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Lehman did have access to a newly created Federal Reserve window for short-term financing. But that couldn't save the firm because the basic problem remains: When markets turn nervous, creditors will stop lending, forcing Wall Street to dump holdings at distressed prices.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Big commercial banks, on the other hand, can hold securities until markets rebound. That gives them a big edge and explains why their model will prevail.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Exorbitant pay**  
&gt;  
&gt;The Wall Street playbook calls for taking home the highest pay possible when times are good and giving none of it back when times are tough.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Since the securities business is cyclical, it would make sense for firms to bank their bonuses forward so that if profits are plentiful one year but disappear the next, part of the compensation is returned to shareholders.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;But that's not how the Street works. The pay practices at Lehman are highly instructive. When it came to granting stock to employees, Lehman was incredibly extravagant.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Before Lehman raised equity capital this year, grants of options and restricted stock left 30% of shares in employees' hands. To be sure, employees have lost billions in recent months. But they took out plenty over the years.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Fuld, for example, has cashed out almost $500 million worth of stock in his 14 years as CEO, according to Fortune's Allan Sloan; that's four times Lehman's stock market capitalization as of Monday morning.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;In fiscal 2006 and 2007, Fuld earned a total of more than $80 million, an astounding sum for a company Lehman's size. Lehman's general counsel Thomas Russo made more than $12 million in each of those years. Top lawyers for much larger U.S. companies make a fraction of that amount.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Given all of this excess, there's no way this business model can last. The best bet is that Morgan Stanley will eventually be absorbed by a big bank that will reduce leverage, shrink pay scales, fund assets with deposits and impose strict risk controls. That's what JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is doing with the old Bear Stearns and what Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis will no doubt do with Merrill.  
&gt;  
&gt;.  
&gt;  
&gt;Goldman, on the other hand, has the financial strength to move in the other direction and buy a bank. Even so, the Wall Street follies will soon end. They were great while they lasted - though mainly for the hired hands.",stocks,1645059951

Disclosure: I’m quite new to reading financial statements, so if I make any mistakes in interpreting this, please correct me. 

while their revenue growth and user growth were really strong, there are some metrics I can’t quite explain from Google finance.

Google finance says that cloud flare had: 

Diluted EPS of -.24, a decrease of 118%. YOY

A decrease in operating income:  -40.68M (decrease of 64% YOY) 

Net change in cash: -304.4M ( -11,343% YOY ) 

are these metrics less Important then the user growth and revenue growth?  Was the net change in cash a one time event? 

while the revenue growth and user growth are incredibly impressive, is the substantial decrease in these metrics YOY a cause for concern?

Applied Materials delivered better than expected earnings in its January quarter despite continued supply challenges. Shares of the semiconductor equipment manufacturer rose in after-hours trading.

For the fiscal first quarter, Applied Materials reported non-GAAP adjusted earnings of $1.89 a share, topping consensus estimates at $1.86 a share, according to FactSet. Revenue jumped 21% year over year to a record $6.27 billion, which was ahead of analyst expectations at $6.19 billion.

“While the supply environment remains challenging, Applied Materials is doing everything we can to deliver for our customers and we recorded our highest-ever quarterly revenues,” CEO Gary Dickerson said in the earnings press release.

The report was enough to send shares 3.3% higher in after-hours trading.

For the fiscal second quarter, the firm forecasts net sales of about $6.35 billion—plus or minus $300 million. That range factors in the expected impact of ongoing supply chain challenges, the company said. The company expects non-GAAP adjusted earnings between $1.75 per share and $2.05 per share for the current quarter. Wall Street’s consensus estimates called for sales of $6.37 billion and non-GAAP adjusted earnings of $1.94 per share.

“Our outlook for 2022 and beyond is very positive as long-term secular trends drive our markets structurally higher and Applied’s broad technology portfolio puts us in a great position to capture a larger portion of our served markets,” Dickerson added.",stocks,1645058152

Intel Corp. Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger, who took the job in February 2021, gives himself an A- grade for his first year running the chipmaker.

In a Bloomberg Television interview, Gelsinger acknowledged that Intel’s comeback won’t happen overnight but slammed Wall Street analysts for sticking to a negative view. The executive said he’s “p---ed” off at what he calls perma-bears. But Gelsinger believes that others are getting excited about the company restoring its prowess and creating “the new old Intel.”

“In some regards, we’re ahead of where I thought we’d be; in some areas, we’re not as far as I thought we’d be,” Gelsinger told Emily Chang in a “Bloomberg Studio 1.0” conversation airing Wednesday night. “And it really is more a statement of the massive challenge in front of us.”

“I think he deserves good marks for what he’s done,” said Jon Bathgate, a fund manager at the firm in Denver. “But the lift is just extremely heavy, and people that think that this can be resolved in a handful of quarters -- even a handful of years -- probably don’t understand the challenges that he was facing coming in in the first place.”",stocks,1645041748

**Here's my fear (in analogy form):**

Let's say I have a friend named Charlie who buys and sells stock. He's a good friend of mine, and we occasionally do business together. One day, I tell him I want to purchase $10,000 of XYZ stock, and he agrees to help. He buys those stocks immediately, and tells me he will stores them for me and keep them safe. 

*However, he doesn't actually purchase the stocks.* He just takes my money, and agrees to take on the risk of payment. Now, I would imagine it's in Charlie's best interest to do this deal because 

1) the stock I purchased is absolutely garbage and he gets to keep the money if it goes down (it's essentially a short) and;

2) he gets to USE my money to purchase other securities. He's batshit rich, so even if the stock goes up and he has to pay it's essentially pennies to him. Why wouldn't he take my money for free? 

The third benefit to doing this is slightly hidden ... maybe he has a group of friends that are doing the same thing for other people. And by not purchasing the stock, it keeps the cost to borrow for the stock down and it allows people to continue naked shorting.

The problems I see with this situation, if it were true, is that it creates a conflict of interest. If I start making money, he'll come knocking at my door because **he** is the one losing money. And it also doesn't effect the actual stock. Stock is determined by supply and demand after all ...

30,Fed’s Harker backs small interest rate hike in March,"Philadelphia Federal Reserve President Patrick Harker said Wednesday he wants a small interest rate hike in March and then methodical moves that don’t upset the economy’s strong performance. “I am very supportive of starting a process of raising the Fed funds rate, which is our primary tool of monetary policy, starting to raise that, and I would support as early as March a 25 basis point increase in that rate,” Harker said, in an interview with the WHYY radio station program “Radio Times.”

Many Wall Street economists have been talking about the possibility of a larger half percentage point rate hike in the wake of the strong 7.5% annual rate of consumer price inflation reached in January, the highest rate in 40 years. Investors think that a 50-basis point move is slightly more likely than a quarter-point move, according the CME Group’s FedWatch tool.

Harker talked about moving Fed policy away from its easy stance in a methodical way without surprises. “We need to walk a fine line at the Fed. We need to do what we need to do to curb inflation but not overreact and possibly dampen an economy that is, in some ways, doing very well,” Harker said. “I think it is very clear the path we’re on in terms of policy. We will be raising interest rates. We will be reducing the size of our balance sheet. But we want to do that in a very methodical way – that is not surprising anyone,” he said.

Harker said it will take “a couple of years” to get inflation back to the central bank’s 2% target. “We would like to get back down and possibly go a little below that for a while just to try to average 2% over a period of time,” Harker said. “It’s going to take some time,” he added. Inflation is likely to be “north of 3.5%” this year.

Harker will be a voting member this year until University of Michigan economist Susan Collins, the incoming president of the Boston Fed, joins the central bank’s interest-rate committee in July.

* But it's still a net negative to ad companies like FB, Snap, etc over what is there today

One very important thing to note is that Google learned from Apple's change that without cross-platform tracking, advertisers bought more search ads instead because the user's intent was more direct. This led to more business for Google. I [highlighted it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/sjkieh/why_fb_is_investing_so_heavily_into_vr_if_it_isnt/) why Google was salivating at the thought of doing this on Android too, in order to drive more ad business to its search and weaken Facebook.",stocks,1645027241

The  stock is following the market and world news more or less. It briefly  shot up 15% this morning to almost 3.8. and then dropped to where it is  now which is has only done once before. Before the Russia Ukraine drama  picked up it was stabilizing around 4, ready to move up, and wasn't  going below 3.5

Not an expert but  HILS has been good for day trading so far since its IPO. If you buy 1000 shares at  2.50-2.60 it will likely be up a dollar or more at some point by the end  of this week or start of next depending on the news.

Crocs released its earnings this morning and said it earned $154.9 million, or $2.57 per share, on revenue of $586.6 million. On an adjusted basis, EPS came in at $2.15, ahead of the $1.98 analysts were predicting. Top-line results were also better than the $585 million consensus estimate.

For the full year, sales were $2.31 billion, a big leap from $1.39 billion in 2020 and the first time the total has cracked the $2 billion mark. 

Their forecast estimates 20% YOY growth for 2022.

61,Are stocks the only game in town?,"We’ve all heard the narrative – stocks are the only game in town. Cash is burning, and Treasury yields are terrible. There is no alternative – TINA.

Does this argument hold water? Let's consider the yields on offer.

**Nominal Yields**

|S&amp;P 500 (Forward P/E as Yield)|4.5%|
|:-|:-|
|S&amp;P 500 (TTM P/E as Yield)|3.9%|
|S&amp;P 500 (P/E 10 as Yield)|2.7%|
|Treasuries 20YR|2.4%|
|Treasuries 10YR|2.1%|
|Treasuries 2YR|1.6%|
|Cash|0.6%|

I've used YCharts and Multpl to source the P/E values for the S&amp;P 500. To arrive at a yield for the S&amp;P 500, calculate the reciprocal of P/E.

    Earnings Yield = 1 ÷ P/E

In terms of asset allocation, I think stocks deserve to be overweight – but the risk premium isn’t great. I think Treasuries and cash have their place right now, given their performance in bad times. Stocks *should* command a premium, and currently that premium is low.

My asset allocation at the time of writing is:

* Stocks 40%
* Treasuries 20%
* Cash 20%
* REITs 20%

I employ tactical asset allocation, based on the relative yields on offer. My asset allocation will change as yields change. If stocks crash and offer a better risk premium – then I will increase my allocation to stocks (and vice versa). I'm pretty close to moving 5% of Cash into Treasuries, if yields rise a little further.

REITs? In a negative real rates environment, leveraged property has a high probability of performing well. I have chosen REIT exposure in reasonably priced UK sectors that I think will stand up to a number of different risks (UK investor). Mainly domestic property and last-mile warehouses.

**TLDR** \- I think that stocks are the main game in town, but they’re not the only game. None of the options look great. How do you allocate your assets in the current environment?

*****

# [Stock futures are down slightly after major averages snap 3-day losing streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock index futures edged lower in morning trading Wednesday, after registering gains the previous day amid signs of tensions easing between Russia and Ukraine.
*****
&gt; Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were off by about 80 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 shares dipped 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures eased about 0.2%.
*****
&gt; ViacomCBS was the biggest loser in early action Wednesday, with shares falling 6.5% premarket after the company said it is rebranding itself as Paramount Global to focus on streaming. At the same time, the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings.
*****
&gt; Shares of Wynn Resorts rose 1.8% after the casino operator beat on revenue, though it posted a larger-than-expected loss per share.
*****
&gt; Markets have been driven largely by concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the Federal Reserve’s plan to hike interest rates.
*****
&gt; “Traders continue to monitor the situa-tion in Ukraine and look ahead to the Fed minutes release,” Sevens Report’s Tom Essaye said in a note Wednesday morning.
*****
&gt; In the most recent geopolitical developments, NATO officials accused Russia of massing troops at the Ukrainian border.
*****
&gt; Energy prices, which have been sensitive to the news, moved sharply higher Wednesday morning, with natural gas up about 5% and oil prices climbing more than 1%.
*****
&gt; President Joe Biden addressed the latest developments between Russia and Ukraine Tuesday afternoon, reiterating that the U.S. will defend NATO territory.
*****
&gt; “If Russia proceeds, we will rally the world,” he said, adding that Washington’s allies were ready to impose powerful sanctions that will “undermine Russia’s ability to compete economically and strategically.”
*****
&gt; The comments came after the Russian government said earlier Tuesdayin the day that some troops who had been on the Ukrainian border had returned to their bases.
*****
&gt; This helped boost sentiment Tuesday on Wall Street. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury topped 2% as a risk-on tone returned to the market. Yields were little changed Wednesday, with the benchmark note slightly above 2%.
*****
&gt; The major averages advanced Tuesday, snapping a three-day losing streak. The Dow gained 422 points, or 1.2%. The S&amp;P added 1.58%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5%.
*****
&gt; Technology was the top-performing S&amp;P 500 sector, with nine out of the 11 groups registering gains on the day. Utilities and energy stocks were the two sectors in the red, dipping 0.6% and 1.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; “U.S. stocks rallied on optimism that it doesn’t seem like Russia will invade Ukraine this week and despite another hot PPI report, as many on Wall Street are still not convinced the Fed will be as aggressive as some are calling for this year,” said Oanda’s Ed Moya.
*****
&gt; The Labor Department said Tuesday that wholesale prices jumped 1% in January, bringing the gain over the past 12 months to 9.7% on an unadjusted basis.
*****
&gt; As inflation runs hot, Wall Street is looking ahead to the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, which will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.
*****
&gt; The summary could be viewed as stale considering the meeting happened before the most recent data. However, investors will be searching for any new insights into the number and size of rate hikes, as well as details of a balance sheet reduction plan.
*****
&gt; “The latest inflation data continue to decimate the ‘inflation is purely transitory’ theory,’” said Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
*****
&gt; “After pricing in less than one Fed hike as of last September, markets and Fed watchers now expect between 6 and 7 hikes over the next year, with some arguing for a 50 basis point move and not just 25,” Cembalest added.
*****
&gt; Retail sales data will also be released Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. on Wall Street. Economists are expecting the report to show that sales rose 2.1% in January. That compares to a 1.9% decline in December.

75,Intel to Acquire Tower Semiconductor for $5.4 Billion,"It looks like Intel is looking to increase their foundry capacity through acquisition. Interestingly, the numerous mentions of Tower's deep customer relationships makes me wonder if they were also working to beef up the customer service aspect of the custom foundry side as well (I have heard some talk that Intel has a relative paucity of experience working as a fab for external customers, but I have no evidence one way or another).


From the press release: https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1527/intel-to-acquire-tower-semiconductor-for-5-4-billion

&gt;SANTA CLARA, Calif. &amp; MIGDAL HAEMEK, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Intel Corporation (Nasdaq: INTC) and Tower Semiconductor (Nasdaq: TSEM), a leading foundry for analog semiconductor solutions, today announced a definitive agreement under which Intel will acquire Tower for $53 per share in cash, representing a total enterprise value of approximately $5.4 billion. The acquisition significantly advances Intel’s IDM 2.0 strategy as the company further expands its manufacturing capacity, global footprint and technology portfolio to address unprecedented industry demand.

Fourth-Quarter Financial Highlights

* Total revenue in the fourth quarter was $1,380.0 million, a 41% increase from the comparable quarter in 2020.

* Subscription Solutions revenue was $351.2 million, up 26% year over year, primarily due to more merchants joining the platform.

* Merchant Solutions revenue was $1,028.8 million, up 47% year over year, driven primarily by the growth of Gross Merchandise Volume (""GMV""), exceeding $1 billion of revenue for the first time in a single quarter.

* Monthly Recurring Revenue (""MRR"") as of December 31, 2021 was $102.0 million, surpassing $100 million for the first time. MRR increased 23% year over year, up from $82.6 million as of December 31, 2020 as more merchants joined the platform and the number of retail locations using POS Pro increased. Shopify Plus contributed $29.8 million, or 29%, of MRR compared with 25% of MRR as of December 31, 2020.

* GMV for the fourth quarter was $54.1 billion, an increase of $12.9 billion or 31% over the fourth quarter of 2020. Gross Payments Volume (""GPV"") grew to $27.7 billion, which accounted for 51% of GMV processed in the quarter, versus $19.1 billion, or 46%, for the fourth quarter of 2020.

* Gross profit dollars grew 37% to $692.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $504.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.
Adjusted gross profit dollars grew 37% to $700.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with $510.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2020.

* Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $14.4 million, or 1.0% of revenue, versus income of $112.5 million, or 12% of revenue, for the comparable period a year ago.
Adjusted operating income4 for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $130.2 million, or 9% of revenue, compared with adjusted operating income of $200.0 million or 20% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020.

* Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $371.3 million, or $2.95 per basic and diluted share, compared with net income of $123.9 million, or $0.99 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2020. Q4 2021 net income includes a $509.7 million net unrealized loss on our equity and other investments.

* Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2021 was $172.8 million, or $1.36 per diluted share, compared with adjusted net income of $198.8 million, or $1.58 per diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2020.

* At December 31, 2021, Shopify had $7.77 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, compared with $6.39 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase reflects $1.5 billion of net proceeds from Shopify's offering of Class A subordinate voting shares in the first quarter of 2021 and $0.5 billion of net cash provided by operating activities, partially offset by the purchase of equity and other investments during 2021.",stocks,1645014596

87,How I made 250% virtual profit and lost 70% of my money. My story of Investing from July 2019 till date,"1. So initially, I had all the money in mutual funds and made about 12% from July 2019 to March 2020. The investment was about  £50000
2. Then with the initial Covid shock, I panicked and took out all the money and maintained cash position till April 2020
3. About August 2020, I started investing in Call options in mostly growth stocks and the portfolio zoomed to 150%  by   Feb 2021. I remember the date 12th Feb when I had the highest gains. 
4. Then the portfolio crashed and my profits came down to 70%. I started averaging down in Zillow, Baba and JD thinking they will eventually go up.
5. It kept on falling, by June 2021, my profits were 0-5%. Then I sold all my Call options in growth stocks and bought call options in PayPal, Docusign and FB. 
6. Baba, JD and Zillow which made up my 70% of the portfolio became worthless day by day
7. The portfolio kept on dropping and now I am down by almost 70% of my initial invested amount. My portfolio shows about £20000
8. It hurts to see the loss of hard-earned money. I got carried away with my genius gains of 150% in 2020.
9. Now, my aim is to recover at least my initial investment but I don't want to deal in Options. But, I can't see how can I make gains in a reasonable time without dabbling in Options.
10. I feel particularly unlucky because what I thought good stocks became worthless e.g. BABA, JD, Zillow, FB, PAYPAL, DOCU",stocks,1645006271

I am trying to understand what is going on right now regarding inflation. My knowledge is very limited, but here is what I think I understand as of now.

When the pandemic started, the Fed lowered the interest rates to stimulate the economy and avoid a recession. During the pandemic, disruption of supply chains coupled with high demand (since we managed to avoid a recession) caused an inflation surge. In order to slow inflation, the Fed should raise interest rates, but that could disrupt markets.

This is where it gets mushy in my head. Why would higher interest rates slow inflation, and why could they disrupt markets? How exactly are all these concepts tired together, and how do we move forward?

99,@Apple needs to be set straight,"Between removing the invaluable aux port so users are more likely to buy airpods, removing the 128GB option (THE BEST CHOICE) so users are practically forced to pay more for the 256GB model, selling charging cables separately, refusing to innovate in any other area than adding more cameras to the back of the phone, making user’s devices failure imminent if their IOS is upgraded, not allowing users to turn off or cover their cameras to avoid invasive hacking, creating trackers that can be used to stalk people, taking 30% from developers profits, and pushing out near identical products every year, i’d say that there needs to be a push to initiate a response to these issues.

28,Where does the market go from here?,"I only joined the market last April, so this is uncharted waters for me. I know FUD over Russia-Ukraine has triggered bearish sentiments recently (at least according to the news), and that concern over rate hikes drove the market into a rather nasty correction in January, but what now? More specifically, I’m looking at a few questions…

1) Are the rate hikes already priced in? I know it’s cliche that “anything you think is priced in already is,” but there’s still uncertainty over when and how much those rates are getting hiked. Are we in for another sharp, month-long (or god help us quarter-long) drop if the Fed decides to shock us with a sudden hike spike?

2) How much longer can this bull run last? This presumes that we’re continuing the bull run we’ve been on since the COVID-19 crash (or if we go back further, since we clawed out of the financial crisis over a decade ago). It’s not “normal” for the market to keep making ATHs so constantly; at some point, we’re bound to see factors that throw us into an actual extended bear market, right? Or have we already priced in the rapid inflation rate as well?

3) Are we still correcting? I wouldn’t be surprised either way, because the market had been hot for almost all of 2021. We just lost pretty much all our gains since the renewed bull run coming out of the September-October sell-off…does this mean we’re now in a sideways market, or is this correction going to be like the first quarter of 2021?

36,[Speculation] TTWO is a buyout candidate by FB.,"Disclosure: I have no positions on the stocks listed and do not plan on initiating any positions in the forseeable future because I got destroyed in January now i'm scared money.

Lots of people are talking about the metaverse but many people don't realize there is already a huge metaverse in GTA online. This game came out almost a decade ago and is still bringing in money because people keep buying shark cards to purchase in game items. Lots of people just live in GTA online.

With FB trying to push VR and Metaverse I believe if they are willing to pay a premium for TTWO they can get the most hyped intellectual property in Grand Theft Auto. Having a GTA6 online metaverse in the oculus platform will pretty much ensure their future.

Other buyout candidates I am speculating:

1) NTDOY bought by AAPL: these companies are very similar in the way they sell software for specifically their own hardware. AAPL can make a ton of money by having real Nintendo games on every iphone. Nintendo also has a similar brand awareness and loyalty like Apple. Not sure how international buyouts work though.

2) EA bought buy AMZN or GOOG: These guys are trying to get in the game industry. Google already failed once but them or Amazon having all the sports games in their lineup would be good for them to have a chance. 

Conclusion:

With Microsoft buying Activision look for other video game companies to get bought of by the other big 3 (and potentially FB)

65,Avis stock sinks as bears focus on revenue-per-day disappointment over earnings beat,"Shares of Avis Budget Group Inc. took a dive Tuesday, after the car rental company reported upbeat fourth-quarter earnings, but investors focused instead on disappointing revenue-per-day and rental-fleet metrics. The stock sank 11.6% in midday trading, on volume that was already close to triple the full-day average. That put the stock on track to suffer the biggest one-day selloff since it tumbled 14.8% on Nov. 9. 

The stock’s reaction to fourth-quarter results was in stark contrast to the reaction to the third-quarter report, when it rocketed 108.3% to $357.17 on Nov. 2 to garner “meme-stock” status. Since then, the stock has lost a little more than half its value.

Avis reported late Monday that it swung to net income of $382 million, or $6.63 a share, from a loss of $90 million, or $1.29 a share, in the same period a year ago. Excluding nonrecurring items, adjusted earnings per share of $7.08 beat the FactSet consensus of $6.15. Revenue grew 89.6% to $2.57 billion, above the FactSet consensus of $2.34 billion, with Americas revenue surging 104.1% to $2.10 billion and international revenue climbing 43.9% to $469 million. That marked the ninth-straight quarter that Avis beat Wall Street projections for both bottom- and top-line results.

Avis also reported revenue per day (RPD) for the quarter that rose 26.1% from a year ago to $74.92, but dropped 9.9% from $83.15 in the sequential third quarter. The average rental fleet in the Americas increased 40.1% from last year, and was up 0.2% from the third quarter to 435,403, while per-unit fleet costs per month fell 21.3% from last year but increased 18.9% sequentially to $170.

Morgan Stanley analyst Bill Kovanis said that while earnings showed strength and fleet costs were lower, he believes bears are focusing on RPD that came in shy of $75, which he said was below Wall Street projections of $78.

Over my short tenure as an investor, I noticed that obviously individual stocks are very volatile compared to something like total market fund, and barely moves most of the time anyways, and the upside is just too unclear and minute.

As someone with small amount of capital, I no longer see any reason to bother with large company stocks as even $700 is a big amount for me. Imagine if I had that in Facebook.

&gt;  
&gt;Troops began gathering in large numbers last November, bringing increasingly dire warnings about Russia's intentions. In recent days the US warned an invasion could be imminent, and moved its embassy out of the capital Kyiv.

* Tesla's car sales will grow 50% annually for foreseeable future. Eventually reaching annual production rate of 20M by 2030. Source: [Technoking himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)

&amp;#x200B;

* Net margins will stay as high or even grow further from the latest 13.1% (Q4 2021). Commonly cited reasons are 4680, Gigacasting... maybe even Alien Dreadnought?

&amp;#x200B;

* Tesla is a tech company. They will generate tons of revenue by selling software such as ~~Fraud~~ Full-Self-Driving, and might eventually launch their own marketplace (see AppStore).

&amp;#x200B;

* Tesla is... *ETF**?* (cannot add a link to youtube video, but it is from solving the money problem)

&amp;#x200B;

* Tesla ~~sex~~bot. Enough said.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's start with an automotive sales part:

&amp;#x200B;

* Say Tesla is such Gigachad^(TM) that it reaches 20M sales without reducing the prices or introducing the cheaper model(s). According to Q4 2021 Financial Report, current **ASP is $50.7K**, derived as auto revenue excl. regulatory credits divided by the number of delivered cars. Assuming 3% average inflation for the next 9 years (incl. current spike) the ASP in 2030 would be **$66.2K** (50.7 x 1.03\^9)

&amp;#x200B;

* With **net margins of 13%** that would result in **66.2K x 20M x 0.13 = $172B net income**.

&amp;#x200B;

* Eventually growth by 2030 will taper and converge to automotive industry average. As of writing, PEs of auto peers: Toyota - 9.64, Volkswagen - 6.88, Ford - 10.10, GM - 7.10, BMW - 4.75. But Tesla being Tesla, so we award an automotive **Tesla PE of 15**.

&amp;#x200B;

* Tesla market cap by end 2030 is (drum roll...) **172B x 15 = 2.58T**. An absolute automotive leader with 20M sales at an average price of 66.2K USD, with outstanding operating margins (\~twice the industry average), with PE 15 (approximately twice the industry average) will triple from the current valuation (or double from January 3's)?

&amp;#x200B;

* Taking an average of 7% market growth leads to Net Present Value (NPV) of 2.58T / 1.07\^9 = **1.4T\*,** so *...* Tesla on January 3rd was pretty fairly valued? Although why would anyone invest in a single stock for a 7% growth versus investing into SPY?

&amp;#x200B;

* From the other angle, if you invest in TSLA now (market cap of 890B as of writing) it will return you (2.58 / 0.89)\^(1/9) = 1.125 or **12.5% annually**. Not too shabby, but also anything but impressive in contrast to its growth in the last two years.

&amp;#x200B;

But careful observer would remind me that we are talking about *Tech* company and not an *Auto* company. But before we go there... let's discuss what is wrong with the bull thesis above.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter 2. Automotive market.**

&amp;#x200B;

Many analyses that I have read address future volumes only from the perspective of the supply. Analyses argue that the ramp up of the existing factories plus the introduction of new ones can support 50% growth, eventually reaching 20M car sales by 2030. What they often fail to address is the total addressable market (TAM), which is in our case the EV market in 2030. To be clear, below we will include both plug-in hybrids (PHEV) and battery electric vehicles (BEV) as parts of the EV market. The main reasoning is that for a wide target audience PHEV covers 95% of all use-cases (daily trips within a city) with electric power, therefore creates a real alternative to buying BEV (what happened to me and my wife personally). 

&amp;#x200B;

No doubt the EV market will be enormous by 2030. In particular:

&amp;#x200B;

* EU proposes to ban new ICE cars by 2035 ([source](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/eu-proposes-effective-ban-new-fossil-fuel-car-sales-2035-2021-07-14/)). Citation: ""... if the EU raised its CO2 emission reduction targets to 50% by 2030, it would bring new fossil-fuel car sales across the bloc down to virtually zero by then... Brussels also proposed allowing plug-in hybrids to count as low-emission vehicles up to 2030 ..."". From this we can assume **EV penetration rate of a 100% in EU by 2030.**

&amp;#x200B;

* China plans to transition 40% vehicles sales to so-called ""New Energy vehicles"" (that include plug-in hybrids, fuel cells, and battery electric vehicles) by 2030 ([source](https://www.autonews.com/china/china-explores-ambitious-goal-ev-sales-2035)). So **EV penetration rate in China of 40% by 2030.**

&amp;#x200B;

* and USA target half of all vehicles sold in 2030 in US to be electric (also includes plug-in hybrids, [source](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/climate/biden-tailpipe-emissions-electric-vehicles.html)), i.e. **50% EV penetration rate for the US by end 2030**

&amp;#x200B;

* The rest of the World mostly do not have any plans for phasing-out Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) cars ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out_of_fossil_fuel_vehicles)). Anecdotally, when I visited my hometown of 300K population (in former USSR country) last winter I couldn't locate a single EV, whereas they are common in European city where I live now. We will make an assumption of **20% EV penetration rate for the rest of the world.**

&amp;#x200B;

2019 automotive sales by region as a percentage of the global are as follows ([source](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/passenger-car-sales-by-key-region-2010-2020e)): China - 26.5%, EU - 25.3%, US - 18.0%, Rest of the World - 30.2%. By taking into account assumptions on regional EV penetrations rate, we obtain: 0.265 x 0.4 + 0.253 x 1.0 + 0.180 x 0.5 + 0.302 x 0.2 = **0.509 or 50.9% global EV penetration rate.**

&amp;#x200B;

The next step is to evaluate total car sales in 2030. There are various forecasts, however most of them are in the same ballpark. According to ResearchAndMarkets ([source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211014005505/en/Global-Automotive-Market-COVID-19-Growth-Forecast-2020-2030---ResearchAndMarkets.com)) global automotive sales should reach **122.8M units by 2030.** Worth noting that global automotive sales did not practically rise since 2016. Yet most of the research firms keep 2030 target by adjusting CAGR, which I personally find as an unlikely scenario. Especially with the recent inflation, chip shortage, supply chain and other issues.

&amp;#x200B;

Nevertheless, by multiplying forecasted global automotive sales to global EV penetration rate we obtain **62.5M EV cars (PHEV + BEV) to be sold in 2030.** It is important to understand that this is a **bullish estimate rather than the base.** First of all, we applied a very rude global level calculation. To be more accurate we need to apply analysis on the regional levels. In particular, auto sales for the rest of the World and China are expected to grow much faster than in the EU region. Therefore, lower EV penetration rate of the former (20% and 40%) relative to the latter (100%) would result in the lower global EV sales by 2030 than we estimated. Second, it is clear by commentary of the experts and the press that the aforementioned phase-out plans are ambitious and can be taken as a stretch targets. Elon in 2020 himself believed that the global BEV market would only be 30M by 2030 ([source](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1310486616075579393)).

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter 3. Tesla's market share.**

&amp;#x200B;

From [EV-Volumes.com](https://EV-Volumes.com), we can take the annual global EV sales for the past years. It's easy to estimate Tesla's market share from this graph:

* 2018: 245K / 2082K = **11.8%**
* 2019: 367K / 2276K = **16.2%**
* 2020: 500K / 3240K = **15.4%**
* 2021: 936K / 6750K = **13.9%**

&amp;#x200B;

Not to raise an alarm, but it looks like Tesla's market share peaked at 16.2% and already started to decay. Two years is a bit short of a timeframe to make conclusions on the trend. But it is difficult to restrain yourself from making a connection between the loss of Tesla's market share and ramp up of Chinese OEMs, VW (id family), and wide range of PHEV from legacy.

&amp;#x200B;

For 2030, in my most bullish view Tesla can at most maintain its 13.9% market share. Take into account the combination of increasing aforementioned competition and almost nonexistent roadmap of Tesla. To elaborate, Tesla has in production four models (two original designs from aesthetics perspective - head and tail lamps, bumpers, interior, etc.) - Model S/X and Model 3/Y. Cybertruck is expected to launch soon, however according to Elon himself, the target for CT is a mere 250K annual production.

&amp;#x200B;

Model S/X is already a 10-years old design (except for the front facelift and an interior update). Model 3/Y's original design is 5-years old with no major updates yet. Given the 4-5 year median time between announcements and production of Tesla, we should not expect any new mass production model(s) before 2026. Especially given an already long pipeline of unfinished projects (Cybertruck, Roadster - niche product, Semi, etc.). By that time Model 3/Y would be 9 year old design (comparable to the current state of Model S/X).

&amp;#x200B;

We have observed firsthand what such aging without any major updates might mean for the sales. Since 2018 combined sales of Model S/X dropped from 101.5K to 24.4K in 2021 (it was going down consistently for all the previous years as well, so do not attribute overall drop just to a model refresh). It is not difficult to understand why. When someone buys a new car for $100K, that person wants to make sure that people around recognize it as a new car for $100K and not say 10-year old used one for the price of $30K.

&amp;#x200B;

So in order for Tesla to keep up the market share it needs to step up its game in introducing new models and doing major updates for existing ones. If people will start considering Model 3/Y to be rather outdated, the demand will fall off the cliff as we have seen with Model S/X. The fall of Model S/X can be attributed to the release of Model 3/Y. But unlike in 2017, there are far more alternatives now to the aging Model 3/Y as well.

&amp;#x200B;

Despite all that, let's consider Tesla will sustain its 13.9% market share through 2030. Recall our estimates on EV global sales of 62.5M in 2030 and we obtain **8.7M Tesla cars to be sold in 2030.** This is whopping **56.5% lower** than in the original bull thesis, and will respectively lead to a **TSLA valuation of 1.12T USD in 2030.** An **annual return of 2.5% (below inflation)** if you invest at current prices.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter 4. ASP**

&amp;#x200B;

Perhaps for Teslanaires throwing $50K at a car is no big deal, but for most people said $50K is actually big money. If Tesla wants to sell 8.7M cars it needs to either (or preferably both) reduce the ASP of existing model lines or introduce cheaper ones. Especially given the aforementioned points on increasing competition, poor roadmap and aging line-up.

&amp;#x200B;

8.7M correspond to 7.1% of the total projected car sales in 2030. Only two brands (note, not manufacturers) had comparable market shares in 2020, namely Toyota with 8.5% and Volkswagen with 7.8% respectively ([source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/316786/global-market-share-of-the-leading-automakers/)). It is only logical to assume that the price distribution of Tesla cars should follow that of a Toyota or Volkswagen rather than, for example, Mercedez-Benz (3.1%) or BMW (2.7%). Neither Toyota Motor Corporation nor Volkswagen Group do not break down the sales and revenues by brands. We will take Toyota as an example as it only contains 2 major brands (Toyota and Lexus) in contrast to 5 major brands of Volkswagen (Volkswagen, Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche).

&amp;#x200B;

According to the latest [Toyota Financial report](https://global.toyota/pages/global_toyota/ir/financial-results/2022_3q_presentation_en.pdf) (Q1-Q3 combined) **ASP of Toyota car is 3.8M yen or 33K USD**, estimated by dividing automotive revenue of 23.3T yen by car deliveries of 6.1M. In reality these 23.3T yen also included financial services, and 6.1M deliveries also include Lexus, but it's a good enough approximation. Under the assumption that Tesla can dictate $5K premium for the same market share, **Tesla's 2030 ASP is $49.5K** (38K x 1.03\^9) or **25% lower** than the original bull thesis assumption of $66K.

&amp;#x200B;

Deducting these extra 25% results in **TSLA valuation by end 2030 of $840B**, or **-0.7%** **annual return if you invest today**. See the discrepancy between these numbers and 3-10T valuations TSLAnalysts target for as soon as 2025? And they often claim that nothing other than auto sales are included in their models.

&amp;#x200B;

**Margins.**

&amp;#x200B;

One topic I will not touch in this post is net margins, as it deserves its own DD. For now we assumed the same margins in all of the cases. In fact, lower ASP (e.g. cheaper models), increasing number of service centers (to keep up with production), etc. would definitely put a pressure on margins. On the other hand Tesla investments in Gigacasting and structural batteries might (or might not) help to increase margins. Drawbacks of the latter two is lower (to none) repairability that would lead to higher warranties costs. As I said, the topic deserves its own DD.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter 5. Share dilution or Twitter polls**

&amp;#x200B;

When we discuss the share price we should also touch such concept as *share dilution.* Even if Elon personally says enough and stops diluting shareholders via his out-of-this-universe bonus plans. Note that for the last 5 years alone number of outstanding shares increased from 0.8B to 1.12B ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/TSLA/tesla/shares-outstanding)), and to my understanding that might not yet include non-executed options of Elon (experts please weigh in).

&amp;#x200B;

Due to the expected high-growth, i.e. ramp ups of existing ~~factories~~ Gigafactories and introduction of new models, Tesla is unlikely to offer stock buybacks until 2030. And even if we assume that Tesla will not raise any more funds either, share dilution will still take place via employee stock compensations alone.

&amp;#x200B;

A good comparison would be Amazon, unlike Microsoft or Apple who offer a lot of buybacks. For the last 7 years Amazon experienced an average share dilution of 1.1% ([source](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/AMZN/amazon/shares-outstanding)). Needless to say this is a bullish target for a company in a more infancy stage such as Tesla. Applying average of 1.1% over the course of 9 years (end of 2030) brings **total share dilution to 10.3%** (1.011\^9).

&amp;#x200B;

On top of that, Elon demonstrated that not only he loves to bonus compensations, he is open to sell them, i.e. increase the *float.* Which is in short to mid term is even more important for a stock price than outstanding shares as it increases the supply on the open market. But in shouldn't play a role in theory for the long term (again, in theory).

&amp;#x200B;

**The results:**

&amp;#x200B;

If I would want to invest in Tesla now, such that it returns me in average annually 10% (vs 7% average of SPY) and we apply:

* our estimated target for market cap of **840B USD**, 
* and take into account bullish 10.3% share dilution, 

Tesla should not be valued more than: 840 / 1.1\^9 / (1.103) **= 323B USD today**

&amp;#x200B;

Or with the current number of outstanding shares: 323B / 1.123B = **287 USD per share today**

&amp;#x200B;

For Tesla bulls: before you say it's outrageous, note how this model still results in $TSLA current market cap equivalent of Toyota and way bigger than VW group. And all that due to the high expectations of growth alone. However, **expectations of high growth over the long timeframe involves a lot of risks, that we didn't even account for.**

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter other product lines of Tesla:**

&amp;#x200B;

As for the other product lines, it's difficult to judge them now as they are in their infancy. Solar installation seems to be dropping since the days of SolarCity ([source](https://pv-magazine-usa.com/2018/05/03/tesla-energy-storage-deployments-way-up-solar-slows-further/)). Since 2018 solar installations seems to be recovering and the energy storage seems to be increasing (source: latest quarterly report). However, it is clear from the financial statements that both of these businesses lose money already on the gross margin level. In particular, Tesla reported Automotive Gross margins of 29.3% and *Total* Gross margins of 25.3%.

&amp;#x200B;

How a company exactly calculates gross expenses might differ, but losing money on the gross margin is rarely a good sign. It often means that the costs of goods sold already exceeds the selling price. Think of it as Tesla spending $100 to buy solar tiles, another $50 for shipping, and $200 for labor to install it, whereas only sells it for $250 to a customer. On top of that there are operational expenses that include general management and accounting, engineers, marketing, their bonuses, office expenses, etc. that affect Operating margins.

&amp;#x200B;

The TAM of storage and solar by 2030 is debatable. It is clear however, that the biggest solar companies in the world ([source](https://www.investopedia.com/10-biggest-solar-companies-5077655)) have valuations of just few billions. So adding 100s of billions to Tesla's valuation based on Solar business is unreasonable. I bet the same holds for energy installation business.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter Hype: Fraud Self Driving**

&amp;#x200B;

This one is the closest to my heart. Disclaimer, I work for the top automotive semiconductor company and contribute to automotive sensors for high-level autonomy. And by proxy, I also have some understanding of the post-processing side of things, what Silicon Valley folks refer to as Machine Learning, Sensor Fusion, Behavioral Planning, etc. So I could probably write the whole DD just related to this topic, but instead I will try to keep this chapter simple. No discussions on the strategy, sensor suits, architectures. We will only talk about simple concept - *disengagements.*

&amp;#x200B;

Since Tesla doesn't share any statistics on disengagements of FSD, we can only rely on the videos coming from the OG Tesla ~~shills~~ beta-testers. If you explore the prairies of Youtube you will encounter hundreds, if not thousands, of FSD videos. At first, you would be even impressed. But we fellow investors should not mix emotions with raw numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

After your careful research you would realize that (anecdotally) average disengagement rate is about 1 disengagement per 1-5 miles. Elon's statements on Tesla being on the path of marching nines is heavily misleading. If you think emotionally, a car driving all by itself for 1 to 5 mile is an impressive feat. And maybe it is, which is not an achievement of Tesla per se, but the whole industry since the days of Darpa's challenges and even before.

&amp;#x200B;

But if we think practically, we realize that 1-5 miles is too short of a distance. In average US driver drove 14000miles in 2019 ([source](https://www.kbb.com/car-advice/average-miles-driven-per-year/)). For the sake of the argument, let's say that not all FSD disengagements would have led to lethal accidents if not taken. Be it 10%... f\*\*k it, say 1%. That is still 1 lethal accident per 100-500 miles. Or 28 - 140 lethal accidents per year. Would you trust a system to drive you or your loved one home, if you know that the system will try to (or successfully) kill you every second week or even day.

&amp;#x200B;

If Tesla reduces disengagement rate from there by 100, You still end up with 0.28 - 1.4 dangerous disengagement per year. That's where the big problem starts to appear. Since a car is NOT trying to kill you for 364 days in a year, you start to become complacent and that's where the first accidents will happen. After few lethal accidents people perhaps will become very cautious again.

&amp;#x200B;

Fast forward, Tesla reduces disengagement rate by another factor of 100. Now it's one lethal accident in 100-300 years! Tesla so far produced 2.5M cars with FSD take rate of 10%, i.e. 250K wild FSDs out there. And that results *still* in 830 to 2500 lethal accidents per year due to FSD.

&amp;#x200B;

And that is how marching nines looks like. When Tesla will fight against statistics as people will get more and more complacent. But we are long way from this.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter Hype: To be continued...**

&amp;#x200B;

I could also rant about 4680, Gigacasting, vertical integration. Especially on the last topic I have something to say from semiconductor perspectives (given Tesla's ambitions with FSD chip and DoJo). But all of these topics I might include in some other DD later on.

&amp;#x200B;

**Chapter History.**

&amp;#x200B;

A bit of a detour into a history of stock market. I like to compare Tesla to C*isco*. Just like Tesla, Cisco was **the** ***stonk*** **in 2000**. Cisco actually was the **World's biggest** company by market cap with a valuation of 500B, adjusted to inflation - 800B. But that number makes no justice to what Cisco was. In 2000 the World GDP was about 34B vs 84B now (source: [statista](https://www.statista.com/statistics/268750/global-gross-domestic-product-gdp/)), SPY was around 150 vs 470 now. So, Cisco price was equivalent to 1.25 to 1.5T of today's dollars.

&amp;#x200B;

And yet, market analysts did claim that Cisco still had a lot of room to grow. For instance, [this bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1999-09-13/cisco-could-be-the-safest-net-play-around) claims Cisco was the safest Net play back then. And another [nice fella from Credit Suisse believed](https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2000/03/20/story2.html) Cisco will be valued at 1T in just a few years! 1T of 2000 dollars no less. Does such claims sound familiar? At the time of the article, 37 investment banks rated it buy or strong buy, and NONE sell or even hold! By the way, article was released on 19 March 2000. See how they almost perfectly timed the top?

&amp;#x200B;

By looking at CSCO all-time chart you can see how the story ended. In 20 years the price haven't recovered to it's ATH. Add to that how much market has grown, inflation, and you will realize that the real returns are much worse than -28%. Nowadays Cisco is the real solid company with a current valuation of 230B and PE ratio of 20. The problem is it was just too overvalued and too overhyped around 2000. Was Cisco a part of the future back in 2000? Absolutely. But sometimes you need to ask yourself how much that future is worth.

&amp;#x200B;

It doesn't really matter whether Tesla is 1-5-10 years ahead of competition. What matters is how much that lead actually worth?

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion**

&amp;#x200B;

My conclusion results that the bullish target for TSLA is 287USD. I am not a financial advisor so only you yourself are responsible for you financial decisions.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. Fun fact, $TSLA is valued at approx. $890B / 2.5M = $356K per every car Tesla ever sold (it was $480K per car as late as January 3). When Hertz ""announced"" 100K order from Tesla, $TSLA jumped around $400K per every car. This creates an interesting philosophical question: didn't we just discover perpetuum mobile? You can buy a Tesla car from a wealth generated by $TSLA which in fact would increase the value of former even more. Could it be that all Tesla buyers are former or current $TSLA holders? khm....",stocks,1644922159
7,12 Rules for Avoiding Misery,"A young teenager contacted me on Reddit, asking me to tell him how he can predict stocks. He asked a person who, after 2 years, still cannot understand how the stock market works, not to mention predicting, but what I realized is, if I ignore his question, he will ask someone else, and I think I am a tiny bit wiser than others who wouldn't mind selling their future for gambling on the stock market. After long typing I realized that it would make sense to post my thoughts here, perhaps someone else might want to read it.  


I ended up writing 12 points, even though I didn't plan to write more than 4. Why did I name this post this way? Well if I named it '*12 Rules for Success on the Stock Market*' I would trick many people, since I am not successful at first place, plus the whole idea about this post is to help people be wiser and avoid losing their investments. Once they figure this out, then they can also make profits. If you focus on profits from the very start you might end up having nothing. Plus if I knew how to be successful I wouldn't be here, would I? So here's what I learned in the last 2 years.   


**FYI: I learned all of that by making mistakes, so this is just my experience and you shouldn't use it as a guide or the ultimate truth!**  


1. **Get to know the company and try to understand the principles as much as you can.**  
What is their goal? What are their promises? What promises have they kept in the past? What is their vision and when should it become reality? How much money do they have in cash? And so on. If everything sounds great or promising then there's SOME hope. 
2. **Go to their website and read their quarterly reports as well as other documentation.**  
This will give you a better insight on whether the company is healthy or not. It is obviously not enough but still better than nothing. 
3. **Check if they are hiring.**  
Often on their websites they might have open positions - if you see a small company like ABGD (Alpha Beta Gamma Delta Inc.) with big promises but you don't know if it's true or not, then you can go to their website and check if they have open positions. In this case with the fake company ABGD, they have a lot of open positions which MIGHT mean that they have the money to pay them, they plan to go big and that's all a SMALL sign that people are working behind it. It is not enough, but if there are 5 open positions in a team of a 100, but everybody is talking about it, then stay away from this hype.
4. **Read the news.**   
Keep yourself up to date. Yahoo Finance is a great platform to show you the news from different sources. You don't need to read every single one of them but you need to know what is going on. Don't sit and wonder why your stock is 80% down in the last month.
5. **Don't buy/sell depending on the news.**   
Often the media tries to scare or encourage people to do something, one article is not enough to convince you that everything is great. Take your time and don't trust everything you read. Many will get scared sometimes for no reason but remember why you are there. Sometimes it is good to go against the crowd. 
6. **Don't invest in too many companies.**  
It might be good to have a diversity in your portfolio because then if one goes down the others will support your finances, but that is often silly because you cannot keep yourself up to date with 30-50 companies, therefore you cannot control your money. But if you have a portfolio of 3-5-10 companies then you have a better control over your investments because you know what's going on and you will know if one day the company goes shit and it's time to pull.
7. **Don't think short-term - always look at things long-term.**   
Like 2-5 years. Maybe more sometimes, not 2-5 months from now. Don't be short-sighted unless you want some quick profits. Companies can't grow massively in just half a year, but a stock could. If you are focused on quick profits, then you have to look for a hype, not values or mission. 
8. **Never punish yourself for making a mistake in the past.**   
You should learn from the past but you live in the present so if you lose money that doesn't mean you should gamble now to return your loses. You will lose even more this way. Always be patient and learn from your mistakes. Even the richest had to fail many times in order for them to succeed.
9. **Invest what you can afford to lose.**  
I know everyone says that but some people really don't know this. If you have $1000 but you think you might need them in a few months then don't invest them. If you think that you only need $500 and you can live perfectly fine with $500 less then invest $500. If you lose them one day then you won't have to stress yourself about it. But if you win, then it'll feel like you have a bunch of apple trees in your garden. FREE FRUITS! Unlike apples, money don't grow on trees but they grow on the stock market. Money kept under your mattress will have the same worth as the mattress one day. 
10. **Take some profits out!!!**  
Don't make the mistakes that I did where you triple your income in few months and then you let your money there thinking that it will be like that forever! You need to take some profits out. The stocks will always go down, some will go bust, but having some money out will give you the chance to invest more or invest in something new. If you wait until you have 10 or 100x gains, you might quickly end up with a lot less than what you had at the peak, or go minus. Being in minus is fine as long as you remember that you're there long-term and the company will grow again, but having your money stuck there for 2-3 years when you know you could've made even bigger investments if you took the profits out, will only prevent you from getting rich.
11. **If you don't know much about stocks and what the companies do and you are very emotional person, then invest in ETFs**.   
The growth there is small, but it is a great way to preserve your wealth from being eaten by the inflation, plus if you keep investing every month a bit, after 10-20 years this small growth of 1-5% a year, could become 30-50% a year. This should be your retirement money, but if you want to have a house in 10 years from now then ETFs are not gonna be for you.
12. **Any small profit is a profit.**   
Most amateur investors lose their money. If you manage to not lose your money and one day leave even with 10% more, you still did well and better than most, so don't hate yourself for missed opportunities. There will be more chances. 
13. **Don't listen to any Redditor online, including me.**   
As you can see I am not that competent in what I do. I said there will be 12 Rules, but instead there are 13. We are all here to grow and get rich, but if we knew the secrets, insights, hidden knowledge, and made a great fortune and have a great life etc, then probably we wouldn't sit here trying to inform ourselves and look for the next big thing. The successful people here are a very small percentage. Most of the people are here to fix their mistakes, become better at what they do, and so on. You'll get so many bad pieces of advice and people might trick you into believing in something that is a complete BS, so **if you want to avoid mistakes caused by someone else, then simply listen to no one**. Learn from them, learn from their mistakes and successes but ALWAYS decide what is the best for you! Don't let others do that for you. I hope this will help you to become successful and remember, don't listen to me.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

14,HIMX - Value Growth Combo TTM P/E About to Drop Further this ER,"HIMX is a fabless semiconductor company that is back in screaming value range. As of market close on Monday it’s TTM P/E is 5.84 but before market open on Thursday it’s Ttm PE will drop below 4.5 after reporting earnings.

Why invest in Himx? 

Here is the quantitative analysis. Well not only is it tech growth at a value price but unlike a value trap it’s actually growing revenues significantly yoy and sequentially (75.4% yoy and 15.2% sequentially last er). Their Ttm revenue is about to exceed their market cap and their gross margin has been impressive and improving (47.5% to 51.7%).They also traditionally pay out the majority of their profits as a once a year special dividend. Over the past decade that payout has ranged from 62.5% to 100% of earnings per share.

Here is the qualitative analysis. They are a dominant market player in their segment of display and touch integration ICs. They make display drivers and touch integration for mobile phones, computer displays, TVs, tablets, VR displays, and automotive displays including hud. At their last industry technical conference the ceo of continental described their expanding business relationship with Himx. Since demand for Himx leading technology is through the roof they have had the luxury of prioritizing their highest margin vertical (automotive) which is also their least cyclical vertical for their lowest margin which traditionally has been mobile. If you have driven any modern car recently you understand how much display and TDDI is included in each car. They were first to market on many technologies in the past two years including recently the first display driver to support 8k resolution at 244MHz refresh rates. 

I’m very bullish on HIMX as one of those stocks that is a clear dislocation in the market. It’s valuation and analysis so not match up. Even after inflation ramped up the lowest and most conservative discounted cash flow model I have seen values this company at $22.42 per share meaning it could double this year and still give you an insane dividend (it will def be above a 5% yield). Even if it doubles by years end and earnings stay flat it would still be below a 10 trailing pe at that time. Imo these are the kind of gems we need to be successful in this highly volatile 2022.",stocks,1644916160
15,Russia returns some troops to base in areas near Ukraine,"[Source](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-returns-some-troops-bases-areas-near-ukraine-report-2022-02-15/): - https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-returns-some-troops-bases-areas-near-ukraine-report-2022-02-15/

MOSCOW, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Some troops in Russia's military districts adjacent to Ukraine are returning to their bases after completing drills, Russia's defence ministry was quoted as saying on Tuesday, a move that could de-escalate frictions between Moscow and the West.

Russia's Interfax news agency cited the ministry as saying that while large-scale drills across the country continued, some units of the Southern and Western military districts have completed their exercises and started returning to base.

Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops near Ukraine's borders, prompting fears of an invasion, especially as Moscow's Feb. 10-20 joint drills with Belarus mean that Ukraine is almost encircled by the Russian military.

Russian markets reacted positively to the news and the rouble , which has been under pressure due to fears of fresh Western sanctions in the event of a war, gained 1.5% shortly after the defence ministry announcement.

Although Moscow has denied ever planning to attack Ukraine, it has demanded legally binding guarantees from the United States and NATO that Kyiv will not be allowed to join the military bloc. Washington and Brussels have so far refused to make such pledges.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was expected in Moscow later on Tuesday to meet President Vladimir Putin in a high stakes mission to avert war.",stocks,1644915441
16,How does VIX Futures work?,"So, I've been doing some small-sized moves on VIX Futures and although they move similarly to VIX itself, I see there are some differences.   


For example, VIX was up like 10% yesterday yet the futures didn't break +5%. Now VIX is down less than 1% from yesterday yet futures are down like 5%.

  
I see that the movements are very similar to each other, meaning if VIX goes UP then so do futures and vice-versa, but given that the prices are never exactly the same and since the movements are not always the same, what am I missing? Does it work similarly to any other commodity where volume and sentiment affect the prices together with VIX itself?

Everyone saved money on their taxes. But the wealthy saved a significant amount (estimates were people making over $600k annually saved on average $50,000 per year). Corporations had their tax rate cut and giant companies like Amazing, Delta, Starbucks, Netflix, and Chevron paid $0 in federal income tax.

That’s quite cheap for a company that has doubled revenue each of the past two years, is aggressively expanding, and is projecting profitability in just two years.

Rate hikes are not doomsday for a company like Sea, they have tons of cash and it’s not like rates are going to 15%. Borrowing at 2-3% is still cheap.

I will be trying to create a live version. Are there any specific things I have to watch out when the bot goes live? If you guys have any questions about the bot, ask away as well. 

&amp;#x200B;

The bot looks over 590 tickers obtained from the S&amp;P500 and NASDQ and calculates the best stock to but and when to sell it. 

If it decides to buy a stock, it will buy the stock immediately at the closing price of that day since I assume the open price next day and the close price on the current day is the same. (money/close price next day)

If it decides to sell a stock, it will use the closing price of the current day and sell all it's volume of the stock the next day with the open price. (vol \* open price of next day)

My main parameters are **(initial amount of money, start date, number of days to run)** 

&amp;#x200B;

If you guys have any specific parameters to run to see how the bot does, feel free to comment and I will DM you the results. Here is a simulation below where the initial date was **1/1/2000** and it ran for **7700 days** with an initial amount of money of **$3000**.

This is something suddenly crossed my mind now. 
Tesla is working on a phone which could uses satellite only. Is this mean if this type of mobile device becomes a reality, then the cellular like Verizon and att would be slowly out of business. I am still seeing people here advertising att as undervalued play. If this is a trend then att is dying company. right? Also this type of mobile device, there is no way for any specific country or gov to truly block it. This most likely means something like btc would be adopted by general public to trade values amd services. Nobody cares about dollars or euros, nobody wants those difference currency and regulations, people would be able to buy any services all over the world with btc. 
Would this send tesla to moon if it actually comes true. Who could imagine cell phones can be this good 10 years, right?

33,Buffett’s Berkshire bought about $1 billion worth of Activision shares before Microsoft deal,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/14/buffetts-berkshire-bought-activision-stock-before-microsoft-deal.html

Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway purchased about $1 billion worth of shares in Activision Blizzard in the fourth quarter, according to a regulatory filing, jumping in before Microsoft agreed to buy the video-game publisher for $68.7 billion. Berkshire owns 14.66 million shares valued at $975 million as of the end of 2021, the filing shows. Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard in mid-January for $95 per share, sending the stock up 25% to above $82, though it’s since fallen a bit. It would be the largest deal ever by a U.S. technology company.

Buffett is poised to notch a handsome profit should the deal close. The stock reached as low as $56.40 in the fourth quarter after the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed a suit alleging that Activision and its subsidiaries fostered a sexist culture and paid women less than men. Activision also said in November that it was delaying the releases of Diablo IV and Overwatch 2.

Credit Suisse says 175 bps this year with 50 bps in March.

On the other hand, I'm hearing inflation has already peaked. Although inflation has increased dramatically, CPI is on the way down, and peaked back in October 2021. Some analysts argue it's a world problem and not a US problem, and when supply chains get sorted out inflation will moderate organically, at least to some extent.

* 0.9 percent in October.
* 0.7 percent in November.
* 0.6 percent in December.
* 0.6 percent in January.

Currently it seems like the market is pricing in the doom and gloom scenario of a 50 bps rate hike in March, and hikes at future meetings totaling 150-175 bps. On the off chance inflation starts to tick lower and the Fed can ease up on the aggressiveness, what parts of the market do well?

I think oil will do well in either situation, but I'm curious what others think. I wonder if we would see a return to high growth, even with rising interest rates.",stocks,1644879628

The question is fairly simple but searching the internet didn't really clarify much for me.

If I own RSU stock in a company for less than 1 year when it's sold to another company do I still owe capital gains taxes on stock sold due to a buyout?

Maybe I am completely misunderstanding how stocks are handled at time of acquisition but it seems strange that capital gains taxes would apply to a company buyout, especially RSU shares, given I have no control over both receiving the RSUs or the buyout.

82,The hilarious Super Bowl Indicator,"There is something called the Super Bowl Indicator, that is used to predict whether there will be a bull or bear market.  

From Investopedia's article about the Super Bowl Indicator:
""__... a Super Bowl win for a team from the National Football League’s American Football Conference (AFC) foretells a decline in the stock market (a bear market) in the upcoming year. Conversely, a win for a team from the National Football Conference (NFC), as well as teams from the original National Football League (NFL)—before the merger of the NFL and the American Football League (AFL) in 1966—means that the stock market will rise in the coming year (a bull market).  

Leonard Koppett, a sportswriter for The New York Times, first introduced the Super Bowl Indicator in 1978.3 Up until that point, the Super Bowl Indicator had never been wrong.__""

My goal really is to build this portfolio long term meaning holding until retirement.Hopefully compounding dividends and having a stable portfolio that sends income my way.

Pro‘s: 

- Blackrock profits from the passive investing trend. 

- Blackrock has very much influence (proxy votes and so on) 

Con‘s: 

- Political risk (because of the big influence) 

- Risk from rising rates; I think that people would tend to take the money from the ETFs and put it in safer assets like Bonds (?) 

- Competition. Yes, Blackrock is huge but I think vanguard and many other companies could be a serious thread. Reducing costs would draw customers away from iShares ETFs.


- Low brand loyalty (?) - I mean, I don’t care if it’s an iShares or Vanguard ETF on the S&amp;P 500 as long as costs are good.

87,"Money does NOT ""go into"" stocks. It's a fallacy.","I have the impression that many people have the wrong mental model on stock market. I also had it before and it made sense on the surface. However it's not correct and it holds back people from understanding effects of things like interest rate increase, etc..

The first mistake is to think stock market as a kind of entity, like a bank. Like you give the stock market money and buy stocks. And later, you sell your stocks and take the money back.

In reality, you have money and say Alice has 1 share of a company. Alice wants to sell her stock for 100$ and you want to buy it for 100$. You give Alice 100$ and get the stock. That's it. The money is NOT is the stock market. It just changed hands.

You might ask, well but there isn't a ""Stock Market"" in your example, but it's right there hidden in plain sight. Alice's intention to sell, your intention to buy, and the actual transaction, records keeping all needs an infrastructure which we conveniently name as the ""Stock Market"". Think of millions of Alices making billions of $ of transaction daily, you have your Wall Street.

But back to the original insight: The money is not IN a stock or IN a market. It just changed hands from A to B.

Let's say Bob has 500$ and Alice has 500$ and 1 share of Astral-Travel Inc.:

**Bull market:** Alice sells the stock to Bob for 100$ (setting the initial stock price) because why not. Later Alice reads news on how cool astral travel is and how it's going to boom next year. She wants to buy the stock back. But Bob read the same article and thinks 100$ is too cheap. Haggling back and forth (Stock Market), Alice buys the stock for 200$ from Bob.

Before: Total money in circulation: 600$ (Alice)+400$ (Bob) : 1000$, Bob has 1 share, **Stock price 100$**

After : Total money in circulation: 400$ (Alice)+600$(Bob) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 200$**

**Bull market 2:** Bob's uncle is an astral travel fan and convinces him to buy the stock back because it's THE thing. Bob goes back to Alice and says he wants the stock back. But now Astral Travel is all the rage. So Alice is not willing to part so easily. She think 600$ is now a fair price. Bob has just that amount of money and he agrees to buy the share for 600$.

Before: Total money in circulation: 400$ (Alice)+600$(Bob) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 200$**

After: Total money in circulation: 1000$ (Alice)+0$(Bob) = 1000$, Bob has 1 share, **Stock price 600$** 

**Bear Market:** Now Bob wants to pay medical bills for 200$ but he ~~spent~~ invested all his money in that stock share. So he goes to Alice and tell her that he wants to sell the share for 800$. But the Astral Travel has now a competitor, the Cosmical Journey. Alice thinks the stock is not worth that much and offers 400$ instead. Having no other options, Bob takes the money and spends some on medical bills.

Before: Total money in circulation: 1000$ (Alice)+0$(Bob) = 1000$, Bob has 1 share, **Stock price 600$** 

After: Total money in circulation: 600$ (Alice)+200$(Bob)+200$(Medical Inc) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 400$**

So the price has plummeted.

**Market Crash:** A banker comes to Alice and offers to take her money and give her, say 5% interest per year. Alice is not happy with how the price fluctuates with her share and decides to take the risk-free interest. She thinks loosing sleep over her investment is not worth it. She goes to BoB and wants to sell back the stock, even without profit for 400$.  Although BoB still wants to get the share, he doesn't have the money. He also became cautious and would like to have a kind of emergency fund and not go all-in this time. So he says he can only give 50$. He doesn't have any hope of getting it at that price, since he is already anchored-on the initial offering price of 100$ and doesn't think it can go below that. Bu lo and behold, in this super shallow 2 person market place, his 50$ is the only offer. Alice, now super scared about this steep decline, quickly sells the share for 50$, fearing that it might go even lower in price. Secretly she's happy that she made some money in the ""stock market"" even though some of her latest moves were not that smart. Bob is clearly in a worse situation before all the share trades. He blames the stock market and the ill-timed medical bill. But he's hopeful that AstralTravel will make a big comeback with the riches in the future. Especially now that he bought the stock real cheap.

Before: Total money in circulation: 600$ (Alice)+200$(Bob)+200$(Medical Inc) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 400$**

After: Total money in circulation: 650$ (Alice)+150$(Bob)+200$(Medical Inc) = 1000$, Alice has 1 share, **Stock price 50$**

So, lot's of drama between Alice and Bob but the money is just changing hands. Not going in anywhere.",stocks,1644857953

Let’s look at how Russia invading Ukraine will effect the stock market and where you should be putting your money for potential plays. *Not Financial Advice* 

“Any such invasion would be mostly felt in Europe, there would likely be wider implications such as disruptions in global supply chain and further boost to Oil &amp; Gas prices on lessened supply”. 

US and NATO allies have reassured they will not be joining the war, if Russia invades Ukraine despite US and NATO allies sending more troops to Ukraine bordering countries. There’s been many talks of Sanctions being placed against Russia, if Putin sends his nation to invade Ukraine. Biden has been putting pressure on Germany to put sanctions on the Nordstream 2 pipeline if Russia refuse to cooperate, Putin wants Germany to approve his pipeline. If Germany approves this pipeline it would allow Russia to bypass Ukrainian pipelines and not have to pay them transit fees. Ukraine currently stands to lose around $2-3 Billion annually in transit fees with the opening of the Nordstream 2 pipeline this year.

Germany does not consider itself to be under threat from Russia. Nordstream 2 was built to ensure Russian gas gets to Germany, without the added complication of passing through many political different countries. If Germany fails to approval the pipeline this would just lead to Russia limiting supply of Nat Gas to Europe, causing a spike in price. With increase demand and less supply. 

The impact of US and NATO placing sanctions against Russia for invading Ukraine. 

- Price Increase of Commodities.

Russia is widely known for being a huge exporter of a variety of commodities that are critical to the global economy, this is why Commodities is soaring on price right now, with potential supply disruption with increasing demand. 


Natural Gas. Russia has the largest natural gas reserves in the world, Russia is also the largest natural gas exporter in the world with Europe being more than 40% dependent on Russia for gas. While Germany gets 40% of its gas from Russia, the UK imports 35% from Norway. Europe's second largest supplier is Norwary, but is currently delivering natural gas at maximum capacity and cannot replace any missing supplies from Russia.

Many smaller Eastern European countries rely exclusively on Russian gas, like North Macedonia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia  with dependency above 90%.


Palladium. Russia is the leading global producer of palladium, with their export as a percentage of the global palladium production is pretty close to 50%. Leaving metal industry extremely exposed to any temporary reduced supply from Russia. According to Techcet estimates, over 90% of US semiconductor-grade neon supplies come from Ukraine, while 35% of US palladium is sourced from Russia which is used in automotive sector, electronics and medicine. 



Crude Oil. Russia is the world’s third largest oil producer, and if a conflict in Ukraine leads to a substantial decrease in the flow of Russian barrels to market, it would be perilous for the tight balance between supply and demand. Which could result to seeing Crude Oil at $120, if Russia invades Ukraine. 


- Decline in Travel

Travel stocks will be hit the hardest if there’s a war, prepare to see many travel stocks especially European get dragged down by the Russia v Ukraine tension. Many airlines and countries will be regarded not safe, resulting to major cancellation and many destinations…


- Disruption in Semi-conductors 

Palladium is one of the main materials used for semi-conductor chips, the world is already facing a major global shortage problem on semi-conductors, a war happening would just make thing x10 worst.  Resulting a major disruption across the technology sector as gaming consoles, smartphones, laptops &amp; PC and electric vehicles need semi-conductors chips.


TL:DR. If a Russia V Ukraine war happens then commodities will continue to rise, Natural Gas prices will sky rocket and Crude Oil could potentially hit $120. Palladium to hit over $3,000. Russia is the worlds leading palladium producers, this is one of the main material needed for semi-conductors. Semi-conductors stocks will be hit hard, since there would be a limited supply. I’ll be loading puts on semi-conductors stocks. Travel stocks will take a massive hit, European travel stocks and Cruise line will drop significantly in price.

1. **Business Model:**

The company offers a range of stock exchange and business services, including securities quotations, cash and derivatives trading, and the dissemination of market data. It is simply an exchange, but it also provides services to other exchanges such as software maintenance, software licensing, and trading software in the form of managed services.

Euronext has several subsidiaries within Europe that they manage. However, they also have subsidiaries in Malta, India, United States. They buy up other exchanges and grow this way. Because they have already built a good infrastructure for the exchanges they have bought, they can run the bought exchange cheaper (cost reduction through economy of scale). Their revenue is divided among the following segments:

* *Listing (15,4%)*
* *Trading Revenue (37%)*
* *Investor Services (0.8%)*
* *Advanced Data Services (14.7%)*
* *Post-Trade (26%)*
* *Euronext Technology Solutions &amp; Other (6.2%)*

Definition Stalwarts:

A large, well-established company that still offers long-term growth potential.

3. **Financial Position/ Profitability**

ROIC 7 % (dalende trend)i , Net Profit Margin (+- 30% over 5 jaar),

D/E: Around 1.5 with ROE of 30/25%, Current Ratio (1.05), Quick Ratio (1.05). Considering the number of acquisitions they make, their debt and liabilities are not bad. Fine balance sheet in general.

4. **Management**

* **Outstanding Shares**

Outstanding shares have been virtually flat over the years. They have not announced a buyback program and so they do not dilute shareholders.

* **Compensation (CEO)**

The CEO's salary has increased in relation to earnings. Except in 2019 when it increases while earnings decline. Furthermore, in relative terms, salary rises slightly faster than company earnings.

* **Dividend**

At the time of writing the company has a Dividend Yield of 1.7%, a payout ratio of \~30% ( differs per site a bit, did not manually calculate it). It has not risen continuously they have lowered it in 2018.

5. **Moat: Competitive advantage**

*Efficient Scale/Scale Economics*

The moat that Euronext has is the Efficient Scale/Scale Economics. They have a large infrastructure and distribution network with which they reduce costs when they take over an exchange. And new exchanges in a country are not really set up.

6. **Intrinsic Value**

**Macro Economische Factoren**

With the low-interest rates, **Euronext** is currently benefiting from the fact that more ""savers"" will try their luck on the stock market. This means more trades in the shares and that, of course, results in higher turnover for the ""Trading Revenue"" segment. If ECB were to raise interest rates, this could of course result in fewer trades and thus less trading volume. At the time of writing, 47 percent of their revenue is dependent on trading volume. A market correction or crash is part of the bear case when you look at that.

**Discounted EPS**

I have determined an EPS-based intrinsic value on the organic growth that the company expects so without acquisitions. This is to get an idea, market conditions are clearly one of the risk factors of the company. I always use a discount rate of 10 percent, here I used a growth rate of 4 percent, and a terminal value of 12. The value then comes down to 58 euros, while the share is priced at 82 euros. With this value, there is currently no Margin of Safety. Also given the market conditions now, keep in mind that this is a conservative valuation as it is only based on organic growth. I think it is a very interesting company and I will certainly put it on my watchlist, but for the moment I do not see a Margin of Safety in it.

In the event of a market correction or crash, this could certainly be a real bargain for me if the market reacts even more to the then-prevailing fall in volume-based sales and profits (IPOs are also almost non-existent then, of course).

**Do not forget with DCF's you have a lot of freedom** in what you choose, that is why they can differ a lot and that is why I always do it conservatively, it gives you an idea what you should pay for a company or when it is a bit too much and that is great. But the number is not exact. You can see it more as eyeballing and it depends on how well you know the company how much growth you think you can put in.",stocks,1644839341

Firstly we have inflation which might last a year or more, then the war in Ukraine in which markets always overreact to, and then the actual rate hikes. 

We know the market has corrected for rate hikes, but once they actually happen, it’s a roll of the dice to see how the market reacts to it, and also not knowing the size and frequency of the hikes.

25,Why is the financials sector outperforming if future earnings growth is expected to fall? Will Financials beat the broader market again?,"Even though higher rates are positive for the Financials sector, for 22Q1 earnings growth rates are estimated to come out to -19.10%. Also, for the first time in over a year, the PEG ratio of the financials sector recently surged, trading higher at 1.6x vs the S&amp;P's 1.4x, pricing in that future earnings will be smaller.

67% of the Financials sector's constitutes are trading 0-10% off their ATH's and 37% are trading 0-5% from their ATH's.

I guess my question is, is why has the Financials sector outperformed the market (with the assumption that this outperformance is due to the anticipation of rate hikes) but earnings growth is expected to decrease even though rate hikes are an overall net positive for banks?

Is this because the market is anticipating the Fed Funds rate to become a fast-tightening cycle? Potentially slowing future growth and spurring a recession?

I don't understand why/how the market has decided to flood into Financials recently due to rate hikes, despite data suggesting future growth will be lower even \*with\* rate hikes? 

Are you bullish/bearish on the Financials sector for this year leading into 2023? Bullish/bearish on banks/diversified financials/insurance?

31,Big cloud winner will be based on who can make the best custom ARM chip,"In the past, AMD and Intel made all the server chips. There's very little to differentiate between AWS, Google Cloud, Azure except for scale and execution.

That all changed when Amazon started prioritizing their Graviton2 ARM chip. In 2021, 50% of all new EC2 instances were based on Amazon's own CPU, not Intel or AMD. I'm willing to bet that Graviton2 will have an even higher marketshare. Graviton2 offers 34% better price/perf ratio than x86 chips.

Microsoft and Google have also started designing their own custom server CPUs. It makes a lot of sense. Intel and AMD mark up their server CPUs by 5-10x the cost to manufacture them. In the past, Intel was a monopoly and Amazon, Microsoft, and Google had no choice but to pay high prices for Xeon. If AMD wins, then AMD will just replace Intel as the monopoly. Cloud providers want to control their own destiny and not have either Intel or AMD grab them by the balls. And they want to lower cost and differentiate based on performance.

This will have profound impact on big cloud and semiconductor companies:  


* Whoever makes the best custom ARM CPU will likely win
* Right now, AWS is in the lead for custom server CPUs because they started first and is successful with their own chips
* x86 dominant days in the server are numbered
* Many analysts are pricing in AMD's expected increase in server marketshares. But what they don't really understand is that big cloud providers don't really want another x86-monopoly. Custom ARM server chips are disrupting AMD before AMD can finish disrupting Intel.
* Intel, wisely, understands this. That's a primary reason they opened up their fabs to third parties. Intel wants to still manufacture Amazon, Google, Microsoft's chips. Yes, the margins are lower than selling them 5-10x marked-up chips, but at least Intel will still be in the game.
* TSMC will be another winner from this because these companies will bid for wafers
* AMD and Intel are the losers. But I expect AMD to lose more and Intel to lose less.

Disclosure: I own Apple stocks, a small amount of Amazons stocks, a very small amount of Intel stocks. I'm waiting to see how Intel's manufacturing will progress before buying more or selling what I have. I'm also waiting to see how Microsoft and Google's custom CPUs perform before going all in on one of the big cloud companies. 

PS. Keep in mind that Wallstreet is very late to react to how chips perform. For example, it was abundantly clear that AMD's Zen2 was going to beat Intel's ass in the servers from the moment AMD announced it. But Wallstreet didn't react until 1+ year later. Also, it's abundantly clear that Intel's newest Alder Lake chip is going to beat AMD's ass in the consumer laptop and desktop market. But Wallstreet hasn't reacted at all. This means you can wait for benchmarks on Amazon, Microsoft, Google's custom CPUs before Wallstreet catches on.",stocks,1644827934

44,The Brownfield Method,"
Recently revisited Jamie Mai and Charlie Ledley's strategy when they turned $110,000 into $30,000,000 before their Big Short trade. It got me thinking about what some asymmetric possibilities might be for 2022- mostly with LEAP options on the stocks that fall into the category of ""beaten down but have a potential to skyrocket unexpectedly."" These will almost always be on the cheaper end, have questionable financials, and may have already squeezed or been lumped in with the ""meme stocks"" already- BUT the idea here is to attempt to make 10x, 20x, 100x, etc. while also taking on minimal risk. 

SOFI- increasing revenue, losing less money, big advertising with naming the NFL stadium. Current market cap: $10 billion. Charts indicate a boom cycle to &gt;$20 every 5ish months and may run up again in march/april if it follows the trend. Cons- run by Chamath who has exhibited questionable success but manages to positively market himself and his companies to a certain degree. Big banks will also probably not allow SOFI to eat up too much market share or their customers. 

TLRY- increasing revenue, merged with Aphria, valued at 3.3B, marijuana industry expected to grow 23% CAGR through 2028, medical and therapeutic use becoming more widespread. Cons- share dilutions and failed expectations have plagued marijuana stocks. Big tobacco can still suppress and/or buyout most of the industry. Profitability is challenging with increased regulations. 

NRG- trading flat despite massive YoY jump in revenue, profit margin, income, etc due to oil cycle and russia tensions. possibility exists for oil to continue to $130 per barrel, widening margins further for energy stocks. Con- Russia could just as easily decide not to invade Ukraine, and oil prices could drop as a reaction.

The whole premise of BRK is that instead of paying dividends, they reinvest their profits into their holdings. The issue with this is that doing so doesn’t directly increase the individual BRK stock price. The stock only increases because investors keep buying the stock because they’re told it’s a good stable company. This is all just investor speculation.

60,"Inflation, the elephant in the room","I have been very bullish on stocks since November.  But once good companies with solid fundamentals start crashing 20-30% in a day like penny stocks it might be time to address the elephant in the room, inflation. Everyone wants to argue whether inflation is out of control because of money printing or supply chain issues,  I say the cause is irrelevant cause inflation is here.  And inflation is the topic of every discussion from work, home, family gatherings or the bar.  And inflation becomes a self fulfilling prophecy once the masses expect inflation to rise.  And everyone that tries to tell you what is causing inflation or when it will end has never lived life before the 70's 80's.   They don't know because we haven't experienced this since Nixon took the USA off the gold standard and we had an energy crisis.  So everyone needs to be humble, realize cash may not be trash, and most of the brighest's minds telling us how to prepare were not alive the last time we had 7.5% inflation, or they were kids listening to those old boomers who they thought had the answers for everything.",stocks,1644795675

66,Looking for a platform that displays (or screens by) basic financial data with a good UI.,"I currently manage accounts on several major platforms, and it is very frustrating that none of them are good when it comes to surfacing all the basic financial data in an easy way for either finding stocks or just seeing the data for stocks that you currently own. (International Brokers is a bit of an exception, but its UI is really awful.)

  
All the things I'm looking for are done by someone, but no one does them all.  
I'm looking for any advice on finding a platform that can do this.

So far as I can tell, Charles Schwab, ThinkOrSwim, Vanguard and Fidelity all fail (I currently manage portfolios on each one). Interactive Brokers is viable from a data angle, but is a bit of a pain. If someone has a suggestion for a platform that can do this with a better interface/experience than IBTW, I'd love to hear it!  


Here are my basic criteria. I'd like to see data on my current stocks and find stocks based on basic financial data. Examples of the data of interest are:

* Price-to-Earnings Ratio
* Price-to-cashflow Ratio
* Implied volatility (based on option values)
* IV rank
* Operating Profit Margin
* Debt
* Projected Earnings per Share
* Revenue Growth over last X years

Amazingly, not a single platform I appears to support this.

Here are my notes for each of the platforms I have tried to use:

**Fidelity**

* Their stock screener does not let you include Implied Volatility or IV Rank.
* Otherwise their stock screener is excellent **but there is now way to display these same data for your actual stocks or a list of designated stocks**. There is no way to import a list of stocks and have them give you the data on just that list. There is also no way to include this data on your basic view of your own stocks.
* You cannot even make a watchlist from a csv.
* Nor can you use their screener as a work-around because you cannot limit the screen to a watchlist.

&amp;#x200B;

**ThinkOrSwim**

* As far as I can tell, this platform would be **perfect** for my needs---or nearly so, except they bizarrely do not have any data on Revenue Growth or Projected earnings. They don't even have a Forward EPS. This makes it hard to evaluate the merits of a growth stock.

&amp;#x200B;

**Interactive Brokers Traders Workstation**

* This platform is viable, but requires extra work, and I'm not a fan of the interface.
* Trader Workstation has almost all the data in it I want. You cannot directly get projected change in earnings per share, but at least you can get Forward PE, which is good enough I guess.
* The problem is that you cannot simply enter a list of ticker symbols and get data on each one because Interactive Brokers serves so many exchanges that the ticker symbol alone is not sufficient. You have to enter the exchange for each one.
* I find the interface for IBTW pretty awful... 

&amp;#x200B;

**Charles Schwab**

(I have not tried out their desktop platform)

* Their web platform appears to be a (slightly) worse version of Fideltiy: screener does not include IV or IV-Rank, and there is no way to get *any* of the information in a single table for a fixed set of stocks (including the stocks you currently own).
* You cannot use their screener as a work-around because there is also no way to limit the screener to just a watchlist or your portfolio.

&amp;#x200B;

**Vanguard**

* Does not make it easy to screen for stocks.
* No method for creating watchlists 
* No method for seeing the relevant data about the stocks in your current portfolio

&amp;#x200B;

I have questions that if answered by someone who is not a noob could be helpful to all. Maybe you just want to answer one or maybe you can answer all. Thanks for any help! I have researched a bit, but I just do not grasp it.

1. Can someone explain the difference between shorts and puts and give an example of how shorting a stock gains or loses you money with numbers, like if XYZ stock were worth $100 and you shorted it and it went to $50, or $150, what would happen?? Do you have to have options on your account to do puts/shorts? When you short a stock, how does it look or how do you close out in your portfolio?

2. Can you actually buy into the VIX? It seems you cannot. Is there another way to buy into volatility?

3. With inverse ETFs, if they stocks they are inversing go down, does the ETF go up? How does an ETF manager set that up. Can anyone list examples of inverse ETF tickers? I think SQQQ is one?

4. How do you trade futures? How is what you win or lose calculated? Does everyone have access to this on their trading platform? Are you basically betting on the market to be red or green at the end of the next day?

If so, I presume a 3-5% interest rate would put the fair value of the S&amp;P anywhere between 15-19 x P/E.

Does this make sense to anyone else? If so, then we can presume the current dips/volatility are the market effectively repricing to a lower P/E given that interest rates are rising.

Nothing contained within this post should be construed as financial advice. Just looking to explore a proposed rule by one of the market's Self Regulatory Organizations (SRO), the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). 

At first glance, this proposed rule appears to be just like any other uninteresting market rule-making, but **a counter-argument was recently written which states that the proposed rule acknowledges that illegal naked short-selling is occurring in the market, and this proposed rule may shield and further enable NSCC members to commit illegal naked short-selling**, which would have a negative impact to the price discovery of affected securities and to the portfolio of those invested in those securities. \*I did not write this counterargument.

This is a pretty long read, but it is definitely worth it as it has a significant impact on the inner-workings of the market.  

The NSCC submitted a rule proposal, NSCC-2021-010 to the SEC on July 21st, 2021. The approval or denial of this rule has been postponed multiple times and is now open for comments again. If the information contained within this post causes you to investigate this proposed rule further, I will include supporting links at the bottom of the post, including how you can submit your own comment on the proposed SRO rule. In a brief summary, the proposed rule states that it looks to create a Securities Financing Transaction (SFT) Clearing Service for clearing SFTs at the NCSS. 

According to the filing the SFT Clearing Service will be made *""to make central clearing available at NSCC for equity securities financing  transactions, which are, broadly speaking, transactions where the parties exchange equity  securities against cash and simultaneously agree to exchange the same securities and  cash, plus or minus a rate payment, on a future date (collectively, “Securities Financing  Transactions” or “SFTs”)""*

# B. Thomas Comment on Proposed Rule NSCC-2021-010

Proposed rule change SR-NSCC-2021-010 should be disapproved under Section 19(b)(2) of the  Exchange Act. 

Proposed rule change SR-NSCC-2021-010 fails to accurately fulfill the requirements of Title VIII  of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act Sections 806(e)(1)(C)(i),  806(e)(1)(C)(ii), and 806(e)(1)(D). 

SR-NSCC-2021-010 **Section I omits the purpose of the proposed rule change**. The language from  Section I, is repeated under **Section II(A)(1) titled: purpose. Items (i), (ii), (iii), and (iv)** in the  referenced section are inaccurately represented as the purpose of the rule change. Rather, these  are the privileges that will be granted to the NSCC and NSCC Members as a result of the  proposed rule change. The purpose of the rule change should be described as the reason(s) that  the listed privileges have been proposed and the equally distributed benefit that all market  participants would gain from implementation of the rule change. However this benchmark is not  achieved in the contents of the proposed rule change. It is shown that any perceived benefits are disproportionally received by select elite entities, as described herein. It is shown that the  purpose is to obscure negligent risk behavior of NSCC members, and potentially even further  facilitate this behavior. 

**Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 2 sentence 1**, SFTs largely do not involve the owner of securities.  The lender of the securities may have the rights from the owner of the securities to lend the  securities, but the lender is not typically the owner. This introduces an additional level of risk that is omitted from SR-NSCC-2021-010. In the case that the lender has legal rights to lend the  securities but does not own them, the lender takes no risk in the risk-situation that they have just  facilitated, the risk-situations NSCC describes in the rule change, as commented on herein. The  lender has directly contributed to devaluing their customer’s asset by lending it to short sellers.  The lender takes no responsibility in considering the level of risk being that the lender has  nothing to lose, yet market risk is introduced twofold: 1) The lender has contributed to devaluing  a customer’s portfolio, which is most likely leveraged on margin as this is common practice and  therefore creates customer risk, and potentially greater market risk depending on the size of the  customer 2) The lender has created an SFT in which they have no stake in the underlying  investment, and are therefore detached from the SFT as an investor. In a true SFT the lenderowner believes that they will make more money from the interest of the SFT to offset any potential devaluation of the underlying from short selling, while the borrower believes the  opposite. The lender-owner would not offer a SFT if it is believed that the depreciation of the  asset through short selling would be greater than the interest from the SFT. In a detached SFT,  this consideration is not made, the detached-lender’s only consideration is that they will receive  interest on the loan. This creates a prime environment for abusive short selling, where lenders  enabling the short selling take no risk and make no consideration to the risk that they are  creating. 

**Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 2 sentence 4**, SFTs are only needed to provide liquidity if Market Makers have failed to operate as required. SFTs should not be justified in the name of market  liquidity. SFTs should not be used to make DELIVERY on short-sales, and thereby avoid FTDs.  SFTs should be used to ENTER a short sale if the short seller does not own the security  (however, this itself presents risk to the market, the only way to adequately manage that risk is to require that the short-seller actually own the security. The counter-argument that, the short-seller is speculating that the security value will decrease and should not need to own the security as an investment, is not a valid rebuttal. Short-selling should be exactly as that statement indicates, which is a speculation that the value of the security will decrease to some extent. The rebuttal defends what all short selling has become today, which is abusive short selling that manipulates the value of a security to be devalued to worthless through trading techniques in no relation to the fundamentals of the security itself. It is seen that the investor would not want to own the security when practicing abusive short selling, and unnaturally creating massive market risk. This point is beyond the scope of this comment response). *If SFTs are used to deliver short-sales, that means that the initial short-sale was already a naked-short, which violates SEC REG SHO. Before even entering the description of the proposed rule change, NSCC has confirmed  knowledge of market corruption, securities law violations, and market manipulation. The  proposed rule change would shield, and possibly further enable, these activities.* 

# Capital Efficiency Opportunities 

**Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 3 sentence 1**, NSCC believes that Basel III capital and leverage  requirements enacted to protect the market, hinder NSCC Members from entering SFTs. NSCC highlights the inherent risk any SFTs have on the market, by explaining that SFTs require higher  capital and lower leverage requirements than normal trading. 

**Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 3 sentence 2**, NSCC believes that the rule change will further  increase the ability of NSCC Members to enter SFTs. This indicates that the rule change will make the inherent risks SFTs have on the market more prominent, through increasing SFT availability and accessibility. 

**Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 4 sentence 4**, NSCC indicates that the proposed netted balance  sheet method helps NSCC Members to reduce the amount of regulatory capital required by  regulatory capital requirements. This indicates that the rule change will increase the risk that  NSCC Members exert of the overall market, by lowering the capital requirements to make lofty bets. 

**Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 5 ALL**, NSCC continues their profound obsession to maximize the  risk in financial markets by facilitating ways for their Members to dodge regulatory capital  requirements. There is no reason a securities regulation should be proposed to absolve any select  participants from established capital requirements that are used to mitigate risk, other than to  facilitate market corruption. These participants are the ones involved in creating the greatest  market risk in the first place. 

# Fire Sale Risk Mitigation 

**Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 10 and 11**, NSCC elaborates how their Members already utilize  SFTs and create great market risk. If the borrower defaults, there is a potential fire sale scenario  where all owners of affected securities suffer loss. The rule change will increase the availability  of SFTs to NSCC Members, even though SFTs are already a significant contributor to the underlying reason of Member defaults. This indicates that the rule change will potentially increase the level of negligent risk behavior of NSCC Members.  

**Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 12**, NSCC explains that in the event of a NSCC Member default,  the NSCC will only liquidate the Net positions, and not the Gross positions of the participant.  The justification is that less positions will be closed, and therefore less price impact inflicted to  the affected securities. NSCC indicates that NSCC Members take such negligent risks, on such a  high volume of securities, that action must be taken so that in the event of a default, the market  impact is minimized. The rule change indicates no proposal to prevent the negligent risk of  Members. Instead, the rule proposes to protect the negligent NSCC Member activity by making  sure that the Member does not go bankrupt in the event of default, and has a high change to  recover. Meaning, the defaulting Member will re-emerge in the market to perpetuate their  negligent risk behavior. The proposed rule directly stimulates increased risk behavior by  minimizing the downside to the risk-taker. In the event of a Member default, the defaulter should  in no case be protected from full default, and great effort should be made to maintain the  investments of unaffiliated parties of the defaulter. Per NSCC requirements, NSCC and  remaining Members are responsible for the open portfolio positions of the defaulting Member.  The only reason for a fire sale as a result of liquidation of the Member’s positions would be  directly from NSCC’s actions to close the positions haphazardly. The rule not only further  facilitates NSCC Member negligence, but it also facilitates the negligence of the NSCC itself.  The rule enables the NSCC to limit their own loss as a result of Member negligence, which  removes responsibility and accountability from the NSCC as an SRO to ensure that NSCC Members are following securities laws and not engaging in high risk behavior. 

# Liquidity Drain Risk Mitigation 

**Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 13**, generally the paragraph does not warrant comment, it only re-describes that NSCC Members overextend their positions and create high risk situations, which  can have far reaching impact beyond the Member itself and cause market wide downturn. **Section II(A)(1)(i) paragraph 13 sentence 4**, *if a borrower needs to re-borrow a security to deliver it to a counterparty, that means that the said borrower did not own the security or have the security borrowed for the short sale. This is naked shorting and is illegal under SEC REG SHO. Illegal naked shorting activity has been referenced again in the rule proposal, and glossed over as normal market activity.* 

*The remainder of the proposed rule change only provides the details of the system NSCC would  like to implement to further perpetuate illegal, negligent, high-risk behavior of its Members.* As described up to this point, there is significant reason to disapprove this rule change. The proposal itself should be replaced with a new NSCC rule change proposal as to how NSCC will reduce the vast market risk imposed by NSCC Members, to possibly include considerations such as: increase capital requirements, NSCC defaulting Member portfolio unwinding procedures, NSCC obligations to make market participants whole from negligent NSCC Member actions, etc. 

Note, this comment has been refiled under SR-NSCC-2021-010 comment section, from original  SR-NSCC-2021-803 submission on 2/9/22, and has been minorly revised for clarity. 

**END OF COMMENT**

If you've stuck with me this far, I encourage you to compare the comment above to the rule language to gauge for yourself the validity of these concerns with this proposed rule. I have read both, and personally believe these concerns hold weight, and I will be submitting a comment against the rule proposal.

**Elliptic laboratories** \- are an upcoming company from Norway.  
At the moment they trade at a minor marked. But in marts - **they will be listed onto the main marked of Norway - The Oslo hovedbørs.**  


**Product ?**  
[https://ellipticlabs.com/technology/](https://ellipticlabs.com/technology/) \- see details at their website.  
*""Elliptic Labs develops AI Virtual Smart Sensors™ that use AI, ultrasound, and sensor fusion to detect people and their surroundings.""*  
\- In short term.. they have created an AI software which goes by the name ""inner beauty"".  
This software uses microphone and speakers to detect presence of people in the surrounding.  
This ability was until lately a primary job for a physical proximity sensor.  
***This means that...*** Manufactures can now replace physical proximity sensors with ""Inner beauty"" software.   
***Which are preferable do to:***  Lower cost pr unit, less hardware pr unit, minimizing logistic challenging and makes a product a tiny more Environment friendly.  


**The investing case**:  
Elliptic laboratories - are already in lots of smartphones product.  
At q3 they said that they wanted to become a standard solution in Chinese Xiaomi -   
And on sep 28 - they announced "" Elliptic Labs Signs a Significant Enterprise License Agreement with Xiaomi""  source: [https://ellipticlabs.com/2021/09/28/elliptic-labs-signs-a-significant-enterprise-license-agreement-with-xiaomi/](https://ellipticlabs.com/2021/09/28/elliptic-labs-signs-a-significant-enterprise-license-agreement-with-xiaomi/)  
For those who don't know what's an enterprise licens is about: It means that Xiaomi now has licens to use Inner beauty in all of their products.  


**Elliptic laboratories - has guided 500M NOK by 2023 as guiding.**  
CFO - has said that one laptop enterprise licens will be enough for them to reach their guiding.  


*On jul 13 - 2021 -* *Elliptic Labs has signed its first enterprise software license agreement with one of the top three leading global laptop/PC manufacturers:* 

[https://ellipticlabs.com/2021/07/13/elliptic-labs-signs-first-enterprise-software-license-contract-with-leading-laptop-oem/](https://ellipticlabs.com/2021/07/13/elliptic-labs-signs-first-enterprise-software-license-contract-with-leading-laptop-oem/)  


This above would be the golden egg, and the investment case for this company.  
It is expected that on q4 - marts 2022 that numbers from the agreement or name of the manufactor will be released.  


**HOWever: in the meanwhile.**  
15'th december 2021 - this announcement came: **Elliptic Labs is collaborating with Intel Corporation to enable Elliptic Labs’ AI Virtual Smart Sensor Platform™ on Intel-architecture-based PCs and Intel-enabled IoT devices.**  
Source: [https://ellipticlabs.com/2021/12/15/elliptic-labs-brings-ai-virtual-smart-sensor-platform-to-the-pc-market/](https://ellipticlabs.com/2021/12/15/elliptic-labs-brings-ai-virtual-smart-sensor-platform-to-the-pc-market/)  


So now not only has Elliptic laboratories an ongoing enterprise software licens with one of the top three leading global laptop/pc manufactures.  
But they will be available as a choice to buy at products from **INTEL**. This is huge.  


I believe that being able to gesture a screen without touching it, will be some new standard do post corona virus.  


**The price at this moment: 2,5 Dollars or 22,5 NOK .**  


I rest my case with a list of announcements happened since Q3 until now from this under the radar company:

92,Question about stocks,[removed],stocks,1644772333
93,Investing in Green Energy Was The Best Decision,"I got into investing about a decade ago and the first thing I did was research for weeks. I thought that I should invest in things that I cared about so I researched all the apps, products and services I used. When I was about to make a decision on the regular F500 there was something missing. Environmental concerns. Everything about solar added up. We not only had the technology, but it was growing at an unbelievable rate. The cost of manufacturing kept decreasing while the efficiency kept increasing. Cash flow, market cap, incentives, technological advances, growth rate, ect. Every company I was going to invest in was using this new product. 

That money has multiplied so many times over. The biggest win for me wasn’t even 9 years ago, but about 4 when I invested in the micro inverters ENPH for $5. Today, that product is on my house and cut my bill in half.

Even with the stock down with everything else at 40%, it’s still up 10,000% since 5 years ago.",stocks,1644772243

96,Why should a war in Ukraine cause significant drops in the US stock market?,"The top market cap companies in the S&amp;P500 are companies like FAAMNG. None of their business has anything to do with what's going on in Ukraine. Of course it's possible, that a war would cause energy prices to rise even higher, which could indirectly cause people to buy less iPhones or stuff on Amazon, but besides those very indirect effects, it appears that the vast majority of American companies are not affected whatsoever with what's going on over there.",stocks,1644771078
97,Look beyond the 'now' of the Ukraine and Fed news,"I'll make this short and you may do with this what you may. Every year or so we have a Russia/China/Iran geopolitically flare up. And the market reactions are nearly identical.

From my review, it appears the market may enter another phase of ""irrational"" buying for the next month or two. VIX just broke 30 on Friday and over the past few years, it typically leads to a bullish recovery. Furthermore this turn of the year period is usually bearish for the markets and followed by a month or two of bullish sentiment.

The markets could dive even more but statistics are on the side of the bulls heading into March. Don't get caught up in the and the 'doomsday' MeetKevins out there.

5,"My Journey , my assumption and the future.","My journey:  
I have not 10 years expierence of investing , i am still in my early 20´s and Uni student but i started like many others investing in stocks in 2020. Luckily i started buying on March of 17th which later on became the best financial decision i have made in my life. I started selling my positions in december 2021 when i saw inflation getting higher every month and job data getting better with interest rates still low and thinking the tapering will end in march. My first big position i sold was TSLA at 1185$ with a 550% Profit, in the last year i did some smaller trades on stocks and options. My Position are still hold are some Oil/Gas Raffineries in EUROPE (75% sold) and Oil/Gas Equipment makers for drilling Rigs. (0% sold) and 5% options (QQQ puts). I started selling my oil raff. a week ago when i saw it running hotter and people starting telling about ""How to invest in oil"". I plan to sell the Equipment makers for rigs later this year couse i think they have still alot of room to go. (Looking at the Rig count)   
Till now i turned 250k which i inherritated in 835k (only my sold positions included) 

My rational assumption - Energy Inflation (Energy is a cycle)  
Energy prices rising is mostly not couse of the money printing but is driven mostly by underinvestments over the last years , the corona virus supply chain disruption just made it faster. OPEC is saying they raise the Supply by 400k/bpd but as reports show , they didnt raise it accordingly (some say they cant , i say they can but they r not doing it). Coming to the last point of my assumption , i didnt plan the Ukraine-Russian tension in it , but its driven prices higher. Where the prices will go nobody knows , but what i assume is that the US has to drill more in the US itself. To not get under pressure politicaly and socially and not be pushed to a solution in Iranian Atomprogramm Talks.   
I learned something about Oil rigs , which is , when they are turned off , its not that easy to turn them on and also the whole equipment has to be changed to new stuff. Based on that assumptions Drill equipment makers will have potential in my opion and thats why i still hold them since March 2020 and plan to sell them when i think the cycle is running to hot.   


Always was wondering why we humans are stupid when it comes to investing.  
People do very irrational decisions based on nothing but on rumors or assumptions backed by nothing. Just one example is thursday  , when CPI data was reported . The market instantly dropped in premarket , everyone was posting the end of ""Growth stocks"" , and ""Markets crashing"" etc. Then market opens and recovers midday - people started posting ""see told you guys we rally"" ""Cpi dont matter as much"" ""the selloff already happened"" ""priced in"" ... market sold off end of day followed by a harder sell off on friday.   


Why am i doing this post?   
I wanted to share my journey and thoughts i have and also maybe some of you can take something useful out of this.   
I see posts people losing their money they made in 2020/2021 or even more than that. Even in my real life i hear friends and people say they lost money in the market recently by stocks and options.    
For me it has always been clear that the only thing that matters were numbers and rational thinking and not what someone else said.   


The future :   
Do i think the market will have a big crash? No (if there is no war) , i do think there will be more sell off in some sectors but based on what i see in the economy , i think the comming years will have alot of upwards potential for alot of companies. Right now alot of things are too expensive for me . 

  
I will take a break and only will DCA into the SPY every week , also i am not gonna look into the comments or at reddit at all. I will focus on my studies and try to contribute something to society and spend time with my family.  


My biggest Position i had/hold : TSLA ; XOM ; SLB (90% of my Portfolio)  
The rest i had/hold : TLRY ; CDR ; GME ; GS ; GOOGL ; MSFT ;   
Options : QQQ Puts (Short term)  , SLB Leaps ; Googl leaps itm

6,"Folks, we are on our own.","I have always contended that analysts' ratings are crap.  I've written and talked about this for years. Yet, somehow, I am supposed to care what some backroom number cruncher thinks.  So here is a thought experiment.  I decided what the average rating was for each constituent of the NASDAQ 100 on November 19, 2021.  The date is important because that is when the NASDAQ hit an all-time high.

The average rating for the typical NASDAQ was a ""Strong Buy"".  Since then the average total loss for each company is -9.88%. 63 companies were rated as ""Strong Buy"" and 37 were rated as ""Buy"". No were rated as ""Hold"", ""Sell"", or ""Strong Sell"".

If one were to look at the ""Strong Buy"", those companies averaged a total loss of -11.44%, while the 37 ""Buy"" stocks averaged a loss of -7.22%. 

If we were to go back one full year, the ""Strong Buy"" stocks averaged a loss of -3.48%, while the ""Buy"" stocks average a total gain of 4.59%. Please note, that none of these differences are significant. Having said that, my experience tells me to only pay attention to ratings if they are ""Sell"" or ""Strong Sell"", and don't avoid companies that have a ""Hold"" rating.",stocks,1644763482

11,Capital Loss carryover. Don't forget to deduct your previous years Capital Loss from your taxes.,"If you sold stock or mutual funds at a loss, you can use the loss to offset capital gains you had from similar sales. If the net amount of all your gains and losses is a loss, you can report the loss on your return.  

You can report current year net losses up to $3,000 — or $1,500 if married filing separately. Carry over net losses of more than $3,000 to next year’s return. You can carry over capital losses indefinitely.  Figure your allowable capital loss on Schedule D and enter it on Form 1040, Line 13.  

If you have an unused prior-year loss, you can subtract it from this year’s net capital gains. You can report and deduct from your income a loss up to $3,000 — or $1,500 if married filing separately.

13,"Long Term Investing - Blue Chips (AAPL, MSFT, GOOG) vs Index's VOO and SPY","I see a lot of posts saying to just throw your money into an index like VOO/SPY and DCA and you wont have to worry. Obviously blue chips can change and may not produce anywhere near the same levels, but if you threw your money in VOO, last 12 years (since it started) would return 313%

AAPL last 12 years: 1535%

MSFT last 12 years: 1169%

GOOG last 12 years: 951%

no way to tell if they'll produce the same yields for 12 more years (doubtful if I'd have to guess but who knows) and not all have dividends / as high as VOO, but seems like throwing some money across those or $nvda, $amzn for another 5-10 years would be ""safer"" if you just close your portfolio and look back, or DCA at a reoccurring set timeframe.

There will be stocks that outperform, but are apple, miscrosoft, google, amazon going away anytime soon?

30,The opening of tomorrow and Russia’s invasion plan.,"Hi everyone,

I have decent experience in trading, mostly made my money with crypto last year, I keep myself busy with macro economics and the state of the economy for fun. 

Last year we have seen the absolute peak of a high conjuncture that was fueled by central banks calling the current inflation transitory. But with the start of this year (and a bit earlier) we have seen the reversal of the conjuncture. This means more dissatisfaction and less jobs, riots and more expensive products. The latter being an indicator of reaching a peak in the conjuncture cycle.

With the invasion plans being scheduled on coming Wednesday, I expect tomorrow to become a bloody red day. I had my hopes of avoiding the conflict because of the riot’s in russia’s border country Kazakstan. But i’m pretty sure that the pride of Vladimir is so big that he won’t back down of Ukraine. 

This is the reason I am going to hedge my crypto with some investments in oil and gas this afternoon, as I see a rise in oil prices being more likely than tech and crypto doing good. With this I am also considering option trading with a small amount of money which I can afford to lose. 

How are you guys going to handle upcoming weeks? And since I am not super experienced like most of the people on this sub, I am open for your opinions and advice. :)",stocks,1644740244

35,Going to allocate large percentage of Roth IRA to TQQQ.,"For right now, I’m waiting for a true correction in the upwards direction before entry, it’s kinda uncertain right now IMO. As for actual allocation, probably at least half of Roth IRA portfolio. 

TQQQ is diversified, top 100 NASDAQ listings. Its leveraged, 3x the legendary QQQ. It’s up 13,000% in 12 years including this dip. And even before this massive bull run it was up 3500% in nine years (~2019) which is still insane. 

I can handle the waves, if anything I’ll just average down anytime I see red. Make my contributions on nice dips. Maybe I’ll take profit after nice bullruns, but either way just gotta not sell emotionally.  As long as the NASDAQ continues to grow over decades, TQQQ should continue to outperform almost everything. I think it’s very unlikely that in 30-40 years when I’m thinking about retirement that the NASDAQ will not have grown significantly from now. 

So when I start to approach the years before retirement, I’ll just wait for an upwards movement from the Nasdaq and transfer over to bonds or whatever, get the risk out of there and retire.

# COMPANY PROFILE

Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA, known also as Norwegian, it is a Norwegian low cost air travel company that operates nationally and internationally with its headquarters in Oslo-Gardermoen. 

Founded in 22nd January 1993, Oslo

The company operates mainly in Northern Europe

**Sector's Risks**

The current COVID-19 Pandemic is struggling Airlines Companies by lowering their income volume and of passengers volume. 

During 2019 and 2020, passenger volume decrease by 73%, with the lift of some COVID restrictions and the circulation of the vaccine, we shall an increase of passengers volume, still way low from pre Pandemic levels.

# PASSENGER STATISTICS

October 2021 to January 2022

|  Time | **Observed Year** |  **Year before**|
|:-|:-|:-|
| **October 2021** | 1,203,205 | 319,477 |

 We can clearly see an increase of passengers traffic from the last year and the last period, due to the release of covid restrictions, there are more national and international travels. We shall expect an increased revenue in comparison to the last commercial cycle.

# FINANCE

Main Key Points of the last crisis management during COVID-19

* Successful conversion of debts into equity
* Public offering added 15.2 Billion NOK in equity
* 0.5 Billion NOK loss from operations
* 3 Billion NOK loan guarantee aid from Norwegian State
* 330 million from associated private banks

| In million of NOK | **Q3 2021** | **Q3 2020** |

| **EBITDA** | 21 | \-1,263 |
| **EBIT** | \-295  | \-2,813 |
| **NET** | 169  | \-980  |

A clear signal of recover from the 2020 pandemic is reflected on the financial statement of the company, with an increasing influx of earnings and progressively positive financials.

#  BALANCE SHEET 

|In million of NOK |30 SEP 2021|30 SEP 2020|
|:-|:-|:-|
| Total non-current assets  | 7,973 | 68,291 |

|LIABILITIES| 16,095 | 66,841 |
|EQUITY &amp; LIABILITIES| 18,621 | 77,951 |

A clear point of its positive balances is due to the restructuring of its finance structures and debts by selling assets and equities. We can see a reduced financial debt too, a positive point for the company and free cash for disposal. The liquidation of inventory helped to stabilize the company finance. The company had to reduce its size and possessions to become financially stable in the long run.

#  2022 PROSPECTIVE

* Signed LOI\* for lease of up to 13 Boeing 737-800 NG aircraft at favorable terms with PBH for the winter seasons 2021/22 and 2022/23
* Currently, 51 aircraft in operation with PBH through winter 2021 above a minimum operation equivalent to 10 aircraft
* In negotiations for additional aircraft to be added to the fleet by summer 2022 subject to favorable terms

*\* subject to approvals and documentation. Norwegian has the right, under some of the leases, to substitute the subject 737-800 NG aircraft for new technology narrow-body aircraft from either Boeing or Airbus*

\[Would like to add some technicals too but i can't upload imagines here.\]

The company has room to grow, but yet it is still unprofitable in the short-mid term, I expect a modest bull trend to 14-16 per share at EOY, due to the reopening from lockdown. The increase in travel demand shall increase revenues of Norwegian, but there are a lot of road to cover and many inefficiencies to fix. 

 **Modest Buy, Long Hold.**

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-launches-blockchain-chip-tap-181406115.html

 Intel Corp on Friday launched a new chip for blockchain applications such as Bitcoin mining and minting NFTs to cash in on the rising usage of cryptocurrencies.

The chip will ship later this year and the first customers include Block Inc, the Jack Dorsey-led firm that recently changed its name from Square Inc to highlight its growing focus on the blockchain.

Blockchains serve as public ledgers that keep records of transactions on a network of computers and have grown in prominence in recent years. Their rise has also triggered a buzz around words like ""Web.3"" and ""NFTs"" that tout the decentralization of technologies.

Intel said its chip is an energy-efficient ""accelerator"" designed to speed up blockchain tasks that require huge amounts of computing power and thereby consume a lot of energy.",stocks,1644718776

51,What to think of insiders selling?,"I've been looking into INMD for a while and have started to build a position over the last 2 weeks. Their earnings report came out 2 days ago and their insider selling across the board was brutal. Insiders stake has been reduced from 25% - 7% over the year. Obviously no one likes seeing this but I'll try to share some thinking on why this is potentially not being enough of a problem to cause me to sell.

1. I read ""One up on Wall Street"" and Peter Lynch talks about how insider buying is always good but insider selling can mean many different things.
2. The stock did run 300% to January-October so it was smart to take gains throughout the year. The stock has fallen 55% from its all time high so they could potentially buy back shares they sold last year. They also guided conservatively leading me to believe that they wanted the stock lower, potentially to re-buy shares.

52,"Long time investors with still more time on your side, what’s your current strategy in this market?","I’ve been investing for a while and always curious what others are thinking in times like these. I started right before the 99/2000 dot.com bust and been through the fall of ‘08. Those were crazy moments investment wise, but I stuck with it. Before the last election, when no one knew what was going to happen, more than a few friends were deciding to liquidate some or a majority of their portfolio because no one was sure how the market was going to react. I decided not to liquidate, although I dialed down new investments and just saved more cash a bit. Now, with where we are today, I’m hearing the same noise - people talking about liquidating their portfolio to cash. I’m still minimum 10 years, most likely a lot longer (hopefully) from needing to touch my investments so I’m inclined to stay put. I actually have been on a modest buying spree the last two months and those stocks are down, which, when I look at the portfolio, doesn’t feel good had I just left it in cash, but I remind myself it’s all long term investment. 

But I’m curious as to what other people who’ve been investing for a while, and still have time on their side, are thinking. I guess if I was 2-5 years away from retiring and knew I needed those assets, I may have a different reaction.",stocks,1644714168

I've read a bunch of articles on this warning and they all reference the seeming importance of neon to semiconductor lasers.

Can anyone with intimate knowledge of the semiconductor manufacturing process explain where neon is used and how important it is to the process? Does the potential supply disruption justify the 5% drop across the industry? Or is it an overreaction and potential buying opportunity?

I did my own research on the relevance of neon in silicon manufacturing and I can't justify the claims. As far as I can tell, most silicon manufacturing today is either DUV or EUV lithography. The former uses argon/krypton-fluoride lasers, while the latter uses tin plasma. I can't find a reference to neon anywhere.",stocks,1644708107
62,Re-Opening After COVID: An Overlooked Perspective on Small Businesses,"It's ironic that a leading narrative during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the struggle of small business, yet one that is completely overlooked when it comes to stocks. Small businesses have been struggling to survive or outright shutting down during the pandemic.

Let's assess this with a bit of logic. If small businesses are shutting down, where is all that money going? It's going to large businesses like Amazon, Costco, Walmart, Apple, Microsoft, Home Depot, etc. all of which saw substantial growth during the pandemic. What happens when restrictions subside and life returns to normal? People go to restaurants, bars, tours, ski hills, road trips, souvenir shops, and spend money in foreign countries when they travel. These businesses often don't have tickers, and therefore money spent does not contribute to the growth of public companies.

Absurdly high PE ratios of said companies means the market expects this insane growth over the last few years to continue and that's just not realistic even in a pandemic setting as it becomes more difficult to outpace their lofty benchmarks. This reallocation of spending is something that's not being addressed. Sure, small business might not make a full comeback, but in order for these large companies to grow into their valuations they can't have anything get in the way of their momentum, there is no room for error.

For these reasons I counterintuitively consider the re-opening of the economy bearish.

I was completely caught off guard by this when I received one a couple weeks ago for the '21 tax year.  I barely passed the limit - but everything I sold was my personal stuff.  Which I sold for less than I paid for it.  Luckily I was able to find receipts for most of it and will only be on the hook for a fraction of it.  

Starting in '22 federal tax law will require anyone that hits $600  be given a 1099k.  This is going to be an absolute nightmare for the bulk of sellers that use sites like Ebay as a kind of electronic garage sale for their old stuff.  Didn't keep the receipt for that Macbook you bought 4 years ago? - You'll pay tax on 100% of it (minus shipping, etc.).

This is going to turn off so many sellers that simply don't want to deal with the tax implications/headaches.

64,The Market is Never Wrong,"“If all trading stopped at any particular price, what would this last posted price represent? At the most fundamental level, this last price (or any current price) would represent the consensus belief about value, relative to the future, of all the traders who are in the market in that moment. The current price is a direct reflection of the beliefs of all the traders who choose to act as a force on prices by putting on a trade. So, when there are two traders, one wanting to buy and one wanting to sell at a price and do so, they have made a trade, and they have also made a market. 

All that is needed to make the market right are two traders willing to trade at a price. Regardless of the criteria they used to determine value, how rational, irrational, meaningful, or meaningless by your or anyone else's belief system, if two traders are willing to express their belief in future value by making a trade, they have made a market. Unless the trade can be undone, it has to be right by virtue of the fact that it was made. 

What you wanted, thought, believed, or expected is of no consequence in the overall scheme of things unless you can trade with enough volume to control the market and move prices in the direction you deem to be correct. To do this, you would personally have to represent a buying or selling force strong enough to absorb all the counteracting buying or selling represented by the traders who didn't happen to agree with you, at any given moment, with enough financial power left over to bid or offer the price where you want it to be. 

For an observer of market behavior, each trade that is made and the type of movement it creates in prices can tell you something about the consistency of the market and potential for movement in a direction—if you can discern the meaning and put that meaning within some framework defining opportunity. Price movement creates opportunities to buy low and sell high, or vice versa, if you can perceive what is likely to be high and low relative to some point in the future. Movement in any given direction is equivalent to the amount of force that is being applied to create that movement. 

For example, if prices penetrated all-time lows, the fact that you may have believed that they would not do it is meaningless, unless you can personally trade with enough volume to move the price back above the old low. You have to consider that for prices to have penetrated all-time lows, there must have been more traders who believed that the current price was above what they considered to be of value, at least enough to where they believed the all-time low was a selling opportunity or they would not have sold. For prices to follow through and continue to go lower would indicate that there are more traders willing to act on their belief that prices are high and as a result sell than there are traders who are willing to buy at those prices (all-time lows). 

What you believed about value and your reasons for believing it may be of highest quality, but if the market doesn't share your belief, it doesn't really matter how ""right"" you are based on your superior reasoning process or what you believe to be the quality of your information, because prices are going to go in the direction of the greatest force. 

The point here is that right and wrong as you may traditionally think of them don't exist in the market environment. Academic credentials, degrees, reputations, even a high I.Q. don't make you right in this environment as they would in society. Traders, acting on their belief in the future by putting on a trade, are the only force that can act on prices to make them move. Movement creates opportunity to make money, and making money is what trading is all about. This is also true for the hedger trading to protect the value of his assets. 

Each individual trader will define what market condition represents enough of an opportunity to put on a trade for whatever reason suits him. Regardless of how wrong you think he may be, if the net result of the collective actions of all the traders participating is moving prices against your position, then they're right and you're the one who is losing money. 

The market is never wrong in what it does; it just is. Therefore, you as an individual trader interacting with the market—first as an observer to perceive opportunity, then as a participant executing a trade, contributing to the overall market behavior—have to confront an environment where only you can be wrong, and it's never the other way around. As a trader, you have to decide what is more important—being right or making money—because the two are not always compatible or consistent with one another.”

71,"When To Take Profit In O&amp;G Producers, Again?","Hi all,

As usual, I am writing this to (a) bounce around ideas and (b) have something written down to check my own self-selective biases and to evaluate my track record as an investor EOY.

I was long in O&amp;G for 2020 (bought XOM at around $32\*), rode the Delta Wave in 2021, saw a possibility of making a few extra percentages during Omicron. So I exited O&amp;G, shorted them, exited the shorts and then re-entered on the long side. As oil equities have risen around 10-30% YTD, I am again faced with the question: **""what now?""**

* \*As WTI rose, the risk curve of investing in oil equities shift leftward. To maintain my risk appetite and return, I started transitioning to more levered bets on oil (so XOM to OXY, PDS, OVV). The downside of this is that these names are more sensitive to WTI movement both ups and downs, within a range.

**Valuation-wise,** O&amp;G equities are still quite attractive compared to where WTI is. Depending on the stickers and where WTI will be in the next 6 months (as long as it stays btw $65-75/bbl), I think o&amp;g equities have another 10-50% run from here. If bad comes to worse, it's still likely that o&amp;g will yield between 10-30% FCF for 2022, absent a recession.

**WTI price-wise**, $90/bbl WTI, if adjusted for inflation, is actually only equal to about $72 in 2010. Expenses associated with energy consumption as a percentage of GDP per capita (60k today vs. 48k in 2010) are also not outrageous. Unlike most of the oil bulls, I expect the break-even price will rise with inflation as costs of labor and new equipment rise, at least in the short term. If break-even rises to $65/bbl, that $90 WTI doesn't seem so outrageous anymore.

**Supply-demand imbalance**, there is a considerable consensus among heads of commodity traders of the big banks (with a vocal minority of opposing views) that we're still in the early innings of an energy supercycle. Also, the IEA recently [published their report pushing back their previous timeline of when supply will outstrip demand](https://www.iea.org/reports/oil-market-report-february-2022). FWIW, their views are the market's views.

* I continue to have a middle-of-the-road view btw the two extremes presented by the mega bulls and bears of oil. Conservatively, I think it's safe to say that WTI will continue to stay rangebound btw $65-75/bbl for 2022. However, I expect US shales will become a significant player again and supply will start outstripping demand in 2H2022.
* As such, I have and continue to position my portfolio toward O&amp;G servicers and equipment. Historically, the servicers' profitability lagged the producers by about 18 months. At this point, I am fairly confident that this pattern will repeat this time, absent a recession.

**Mass-psychology wise**, I continue to think we're in the very early innings of mass euphoria in O&amp;G. There is little to no pumping of O&amp;G in [r/wallstreetbets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/) or [r/stocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/). When there is mentioning, it's usually household names like XOM or CVX. I joke that I will know that we reach peak euphoria when retail starts peddling pre-revenue O&amp;G names. I don't invest based on the assumption that others will become irrational, but it informs my decision of when to take profit.

**In conclusion**, depending on what happens between now and EOY, I plan to take profit in the O&amp;G producers sometime in 2H2022.

O&amp;G moves fast and things can change in the blink of an eye. As usual, I reserve the option to change my thesis as events unfold (will update if I do).

I receive a lot of counterarguments/pushbacks for my shorts during the Omicron Wave. But I think that made me a better investor. So, call me out.",stocks,1644701123

* Fed raising rates.
* Russia sanctions and possible invasion cutting off key semiconductor materials.

In the next few months, these will play out and really pummel the semi stocks. But the good news is these are temporary events. After 1-2 years, we'll find a way around Russian chokehold on these key materials, and inflation will probably be slowed. While that's happening, covid is still subsiding and innovation continue it's relentless march of driving productivity forward.

To be clear, **I'm not saying to buy the dip right now.** But I'm tempted to start a ""eat ramen"", ""get a third job"", ""cancel Netflix"" regime for myself to start preparing as much as possible to start buying mid or later this year.

These semi stocks are becoming the new FANGS, and this upcoming dip this year might be the best chance to buy them before they rocket into FANG status.

OK here's the cons in my theory:

* China could still be a ticking time bomb. Most experts say their lockdown strategy is not viable for Omicron. Could be their supply chain is a lot more broken than we realize. Plus that real estate problem is still ongoing and their president is kinda insane.

* The Fed could freak out and raise rates too quickly, putting us into a recession.

* Some industry reports say oversupply of semiconductors could happen as early as 2023.

97,Annaly Capital Management (NLY),"Below is an assessment of NLY Capital.  I would love to get additional input from more experienced and/or knowledgeable investors.

I've always loved the idea of investing in rental properties that essentially pay you to own them.  The thing that kept me from doing so was the fact that...

1. Risk Profile:  Purchasing a single property is capital intensive and would represent a large part of my portfolio with very little actual diversity
2. Management:  Rental properties require actual work and I'm not exactly like my dad where I can go in and fix anything
3. Liquidity:  There are substantial costs in unloading a property and, depending on the market conditions, may take significant time

After some thought, I began considering REITs which would give me exposure to real-estate while solve pretty much all of these problems.  I really liked NLY due to the high yield, currently sitting at nearly 12%.

Based on what I've read about NLY, they purchase mortgage-backed securities (MBS) from Fannie and Freddie.  To amplify their profits, they borrow money.  Thus, their profits are the difference between their borrowing costs and the MBS they hold.  This means they are incredibly sensitive to changes in interest rates, which is of particular concern right now.  Additionally, as with any dividend-based investment, there are some serious questions about how safe that dividend is.

The upside is that, by law, an REIT is required to distribute their profits to shareholders, so as long as the company is profitable, there will be some sort of dividend.  The real risk seems to be whether or not they can continue as a going concern and the actual dividend being paid out.

NLY has a long history, having started in 1997.  During this time, NLY has had to weather quite a few crisis:

* Dot Com Bust
* 2007 Subprime Meltdown
* 2018-19 Taper Tantrum
* 2020 COVID

Based on the information I was able to cobble together, it looks like they've maintained their dividend since at least June of 2013.  The TTM yield has varied between 9% and around 12.1% during this time.  It seems fairly correlated to stock prices, so this suggests that either management is intentionally maintaining the dividend in this range or the underlying fundamental market forces keep this locked in that range.

On the surface, this is a good thing:  it means they were able to maintain their dividend during a period where sharp rate increases seem likely.

A quick view of their Net Income paints an uglier story.  Between 2018Q4 and 2020Q1, Net Income was negative.  TTM Net Income was negative for 9 quarters straight.  In fact, Net Income wasn't consistently positive until after the Pandemic and the rates began getting slashed.   This immediately makes me question how they were able to fund their dividend.

I looked at their share count and since May of 2013, share count has increased from 947M to 1.45B--about a 55% increase in total shares, suggesting significant dilution.  A huge portion of this stems from changes made in late 2017 and late 2018.  My guess is that this was how they managed to fund their dividend during the rate hikes

Based on what I've read, I don't personally believe that this is an investment that I want to take on.  Even though their dividend was stable, it seems that they were not able to navigate a situation where rates were increasing and in fact, had to fund their dividend using other people's money, not cash from operations.

My consensus is to take a pass on this.

4,Digging into CPI Numbers,"Hey All,

After seeing the CPI numbers come in at a hefty 7.5%, I was looking a bit deeper into the CPI numbers, I was curious to know what was driving that.  By-and-large, it's the same story we've seen:

1. Commodities (Food, Energy, etc.)
2. Transportation Cars

I'm wondering, is this inflation actually more transitory than we think?  Commodities can be volatile.  If the underlying price increase is driven by supply relative to demand and the associated speculation, would the price that those commodities trade at begin to fall if demand falls?  This may take some time, but we've seen spectacular collapses in commodities markets before.

Similar to commodities, once supply chains problems begin to work themselves out, would we expect to see dealerships begin to trim margins or offer deeper discounts as customers have relatively more options?

Now, prices do tend to be sticky and it may be grocery stores will keep their prices as is if the commodity prices drop and they'll pocket the profit, but discount chains could begin forcing price competition.

5,A look on the bright side,"Between inflation concerns, rate increases and Russia/Ukraine there is plenty of catalysts to be cautious of for the market. But there’s always two sides so I wanted to take a look at some of the positives we have seen in the market recently:

While some companies have been hit by earnings overall many have posted solid growth numbers, particularly for revenue. Supply chain concerns weighing down earnings are not likely to be long term drags.

There is still clear buying pressure and outside of certain key names most dips are being bought and the floor is not falling out. 

While rising costs of good is clearly a concern, there has been real wage movement as we see workers gaining leverage as demand for them rises.

After mid terms we might actually get meaningful legislation passed which could boost the economy or at least provide more clarity on the political picture for the next 2 years. 

These are some of the positive trends I see that can impact the market. I think the market has been taking earnings much more seriously but for those posting strong earnings I see real upward potential especially for second half of the year",stocks,1644668398

Im hoping you can help me considering my broker IBKR does not have any customer service lines open on the weekend.

So I have deposited approx 2.7 K GBP to my IBKR Margin account. I had access to approximately 9 K GBP Leverage. My positions total value sat around 4.4 K GBP (meaning im trading on about 1.6x leverage. My target position GRPN 1.8 K GBP. Dropped last night to 0 in value. I don't know why this is? I woke up this morning and saw it at 0. If it was IBKR liquidating my position due to lack excess liquidity. it should have been liquidated at 77 (Shares) x 24.05 (PPS). Is this a bug? I checked the latest news for GRPN as well and nothing significant enough for a 0 value on the shares.

&amp;#x200B;

10,Looking to start a stocks/brokerage account. Which platform/service is right for me?,"So I just started my first job out of college/university and I'm looking to start investing in some stocks, index funds, etc. I am in the United States. I've been using [this NerdWallet article](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/online-brokers-for-beginners) to make a decision on a few platforms. So far, it seems like I might go with TD Ameritrade, Fidelity, E-Trade, or Robinhood.

I'm curious as to what the best platform for someone like me will be. **In general, I plan to be a buy-and-hold type of person.** I do NOT intend to be a day trader or someone who is going to be buying and selling very frequently. Right now, I'm hoping for some ROI in about 1-5 years from now and am intent on buying and holding most stocks for at least a year at a time with about $2k-$10k invested by the end of the year.

Things I will in particularly value are as follows:

1. **No fees or subscriptions except for known/standard fee-oriented purchases.** It seems most services are free of fees with few exceptions. For example, I know mutual funds have a like 1% fee for administration which is fairly standard, but I wouldn't be willing to pay just to trade common stock. As someone who will be starting with low volume and low trade frequency, I don't think it's worth it to use a service with fees or subscriptions except for where fees are fairly  standard.
2. **Desktop and mobile app offerings with a good UI.**
3. **Ability to view price history as a simple line graph.** [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=NASDAQ:+MSFT&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgecRoyi3w8sc9YSmdSWtOXmNU4-IKzsgvd80rySypFJLgYoOy-KR4uLj0c_UNzKty8uIteRax8vg5Brs4Blop-Aa7hQAAJFwipEkAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwje2o-N-vn1AhUfnGoFHVMyDRgQsRV6BAhaEAM&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=929&amp;dpr=1) and Robinhood have traditional line graphs that I look at, so that is what I'm used to and find most appealing. [On FINVIZ, the default view is candle](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=MSFT&amp;ty=c&amp;ta=0&amp;p=d&amp;tas=0), but  can be changed to simple line. I'm mostly referring to viewing one stock at a time here. Of course any ability to have complex user interface views is another story.
4. **Automatic 1099-B Form preparation/delivery.**
5. **Limit ordering.** It would be really convenient to be able to buy or sell at a certain price while I don't have to be there to do it manually and can just schedule it for when that price is reached (if it is reached). Again, I am unaware if this is common on most platforms. Robinhood has this.
6. **No excessive advertisements.** As a beginner, I'm unaware if there are any platforms that have excessive banner or compulsory video advertisements.

I may consider investing in international stocks or currencies (ones on non-American based exchanges) in the long-term, so if specific platforms offer that, that would be nice for later on. I also do crypto with coinbase, so I'm not looking for ability to trade crypto.

I guess if you can also answer what happens if your service/platform gets acquired, that would be nice to know in advance. I had a teacher who used to use TradeKing, which was acquired by Ally Invest, and I'm unaware if acquisition can have like complex implications. In a similar category, what would happen to your holdings if you trade on a platform that shuts down?

I'll also be starting a 401(k) and an IRA, too. If there is any benefit, convenience, or incentive to making all accounts with one service/platform, please let me know too as I will take that into consideration.",stocks,1644663048

17,Does anyone else feel like we are about to experience a catastrophic change in finance?,"I recognize that my perspective is heavily influenced by the information and content that I expose myself to. I’m a novice to finance and stocks and I know I am in fact naive. I began investing and trading in late 2020, so up until now I’ve experienced relentless optimism in the market, and in my portfolio. 

I know at this point we are all well aware of the 40 year high inflation and the gigantic bubble that is the US (and perhaps global) economy. We are all coming to terms with the fact that the face melting bull run of the last two years is coming to an end, and likely sooner than later. 

Now setting that aside, is anyone else getting the sense that finance as we know it, might be coming to an end? Monetary policy for the past 14 years following 2008 (plus a lot of other things) seems to have brought us right to the brink of economic collapse. The Fed is no longer being proactive about mitigating inflation, but instead trying to react to it. 

I think concern over the fact that the Fed seems to have totally lost control is warranted. To be candid, I personally don’t think this situation we’re in was an “oops” and it’s hard to imagine that this is all not by design in some way. 

I’m not at all a sucker for the narrative being created by the financial news shows, and for the most part I do not tune into them at all. I understand their spin weighs heavy on the underlying emotions in the stock market. That being said, this is the first time in my investing journey that the information I’m consuming is overwhelmingly bearish. Not just bearish though, but quite frankly *alarmist*. 

The economic situation we are in currently is probably something to be alarmed over, in my opinion. I think at best we will experience a proper market crash followed by a recession, triggered by the conclusion of QE and rising interest rates, which when combined with all of the other economic struggles the US is facing, won’t look pretty. At worst, we could be launched into economic turmoil so unprecedented, that we will never return to business as usual - and what I mean by that, I don’t really know. 

I don’t have a plan for what’s to come. I have no hedges against a falling market. I honestly have no clue what I’m talking about or what’s going to come next. This is essentially just an assortment of my thoughts and feelings assembled into a rambling monologue.

Please don’t take anything I’ve said too seriously. I just thought I’d share my thoughts here and see what others have to say. Have I just gotten sucked into the emotional market narrative? Or is it likely that what’s to come is going to be very bad?",stocks,1644653322

38,GOLD. Year of great gains. Preserve wealth and enhance it.,"Despite the challenging macro backdrop of supply chain issues, surging inflation and lingering pandemic risks, Bank of America strategists have noted that some of the investment flows into gold have been very resilient.

“[There are significant dislocations buried beneath headline inflation, interest rates and currency moves, raising the appeal of holding the yellow metal in a portfolio and supporting our $1,925/oz average gold price forecast for 2022,” BofA analysts said in a research note at the end of January.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/07/gold-has-remained-steady-as-stocks-and-bitcoin-have-plunged.html)





Gold futures ended higher on Thursday, stretching their streak of gains to a fifth session in a row - the longest run of consecutive gains since November. The rise for the metal came in the wake of data showing the U.S. consumer price index rose by a more than expected 0.6% in January to 7.5%, a 40-year high. [Gold's rise ""underscores its status as safe-haven commodity, and an effective inflation hedge,"" said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst at ThinkMarkets.](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gold-futures-up-5-session-in-a-row-longest-streak-of-gains-since-november-2022-02-10)


[The stock market bubble has burst. Widely owned companies such as PayPal -36%, Facebook -34% and Netflix -33% have been beaten down.](https://bytetree.com/research/2022/02/the-equity-bubble-bursts/)




The remaining FAANGs have fared better, but it’s only a matter of time before they collapse too. They are simply mispriced, and no asset can swim against the tide forever, especially when the debt cycle is over.



With so much uncertainty, the case for gold is a strong one and you can watch the interview here. We thank Duncan for a thoughtful discussion and look forward to speaking to John Reade, Head of the World Gold Council, at the end of February. What he doesn’t know about the gold market isn’t worth knowing.




Ruffer played their cards well. They saw risk-on conditions return in late 2020, swapped a little gold for [redacted], bagged the profits and bought back their gold. Spectacular.



It is rare for gold to do well during bull markets, and by holding it, investors risk underperformance. This is why gold beating the S&amp;P 500 is key, as it gives investors the confidence they won’t underperform. It’s happening, and I believe this could go on for some time yet.

51,Money printing and inflation,"Inflation is the decline of purchasing power of a given currency over time.

I think everyone would agree on the definition of inflation as per above, but views on what causes it tend to differ quite a lot sometimes.

For example, some people argue that the current inflation rate is mainly caused by the monetary and fiscal policies implemented over the last years, central banks printed too much money. The problem with this argument is, however, that the correlation between money supply and CPI is hard to prove. Japan is a prime example of this, its money supply has increased enormously over the last decades and not only hasn't it experienced inflation, it's even been struggling with deflation for more than two decades. US and Europe too have increased significantly their money supply over the last decade and neither of them experienced high and persistent inflation.

It's true that, in some cases, money printing causes inflation, but the increase in prices of goods and services is not a direct effect of money printing. In fact, inflation only occurs if the new money increases demand to the point that supply can't keep up.

Inflation can be caused by many factors (e.g. cost-push inflation, demand-pull inflation, self-fulfilling inflation expectations and Phillips curve). And depending on what causes inflation, central banks may or may not be able to implement a proper and effective policy in response to it. If inflation is demand driven, then hiking interest rates is the solution, but if supply chain issues and the statistics being messed up by the pandemic are the main causes of inflation, hiking interest rates will sure lower inflation but it will also kill demand, which would be like curing the disease by killing the patient.

56,SQQQ - Discussion around Short ETFs,"I haven't participated in shorting anything in the market because we've been on a bull run since I tossed my first dollar into the market about 4-5 years ago. 

I think that might change (and you're entitled to your opinion as well). One thing we can certainly agree on is that the overall market sentiment is different now, there's a lot more fear now than there has been since I've invested (besides the initial covid dump) with countries on the brink of war, the supply chain issues persisting, semiconductor shortages effecting every technological facet of our lives, and of course the looming rate hikes over the entire market/economy - I've lost a lot of my confidence in the market for these reasons.

I'm looking into some short plays and for the sake of this discussion I'll stick to talking about SQQQ. I noticed that prior to March 2019 SQQQ was consistently dropping until the covid fear kicked in. The -3x leveraged ETF shot up from $240 to $1,111 in a single day - INSANE!

However, fast-forward to today and it sits at a measly $41, the lowest it's been. Why is that? Sure it had a good day today (up nearly 10%) but that's just a few bucks, still far off the mark of what it was right before covid.

62,Fundamental analysis and valuation of Airbnb - Hyped from the start (value $79.87 vs price $171.95),"Airbnb went public on December 10th, 2020, which is not that long time ago. The IPO price was $68/share and on the first day, it opened at $146. This already points to the fear of missing out to invest in a company that disrupts an industry as the demand was incredibly high.

In this relatively short period, the stock price was very volatile moving from $130 to $220 a couple of times. For a company that is highly dependent on traveling, to go public in the middle of a pandemic is definitely brave. Currently, the market cap of the company is at around $106b, but let's round it down to $100b and we can refer back to it.

In this post, as in all of the previous ones, I'll do my best to provide an in-depth analysis of the company's fundamentals and at the end provide calculate its intrinsic value based on certain assumptions.

**How does Airbnb make money?**

We can divide the company into two operating segments:

&amp;#x200B;

**Segment #1** \- Marketplace that connects hosts and guests (both groups are customers of the company) - This is what the company is known for.

It gets 3% flat-free from the hosts and anywhere between 6% and 12% from the guests. The average take-rate has been around 13% of the gross booking value. The total addressable market is estimated at around $2 trillion:

\-$1.8t is related to short-term stays. 

\-$210m related to long-term stays

There's no doubt that this is a disruptive business as it provided value to both the hosts and the guests. On one side, the hosts have an easy way to set up their business and make money from their property that is not being used. 

On the other side, the users have more affordable alternatives to choose from. 

&amp;#x200B;

**Segment #2** \- Marketplace that connects experience hosts and experience users.

There has been an attempt to sell this as an important part of their business and their take-rate, in this case, would be around 20%. I did some research to figure out what kind of experiences are available around my area and in some major cities and I was not very happy with the results. The most common ones were restaurants and photoshoots. It is clear that the first segment is disruptive, but I am fairly pessimistic about this one. There are plenty of alternatives to find what to do in a given place and when it comes to restaurants, I would say Google Maps is one of the go-to place as it has lots of reviews as well.

Although the total addressable market is $1.4t, I am not confident that Airbnb can capture a significant portion of it. Of course, I could be wrong.

&amp;#x200B;

**How did they perform in the past?**

Let's start with the gross bookings, which is the value of the services provided through their platform. In 2017, there were roughly $20b gross bookings and this amount more than doubled to $41.5b for the last 12 months (ending September 2021).

Their cut is around 13%, so the revenue that the company brings increased from $2.5b in 2017 to $5.3b for the last twelve months. That means the company's currently trading at over 20x Price/sales. Of course, it is too early to draw any conclusions, there are plenty of pieces of the puzzle to put together.

&amp;#x200B;

**What about the margins?**

The first costs that they need to cover are the direct costs, in this case, payment processing fees, costs related to 3rd party data centers that are used to host the platform, and community (customer) support. Historically, they've been around 40% of the revenue, which brings the gross margin to 60%. The economy of scale can definitely kick in here and I would not be surprised if the gross margin increase to 70% over time.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, there are 3 operating expenses that need to be covered:

\- Product development (16% of revenue in 2017 to 59% LTM)

\- Sales &amp; Marketing (34% of revenue  in 2017 to 28% LTM)

\- General &amp; Administrative (13% of revenue in 2017 to $25% LTM)

\- Restructuring (0% of revenue in 2017 vs 2% LTM) - During 2020, Airbnb reduced the # of employees by 25%

&amp;#x200B;

If we deduct these percentages from the gross margin, we can see that in 2017, they had a negative operating margin of 3.2%, while for the LTM, it is negative over 50%. This is not surprising as the pandemic had a huge impact.

So, looking into the future, there are three main questions to answer:

**Question #1 How quickly can the company grow the top line?**

The analysts are forecasting growth between 12% and 32% for 2022. My assumption for the next twelve months is 30%. It might seem that I'm on the high end, however, as my base year, I have the last twelve months up to September 2021, so I'm forecasting 1 quarter of 2021 and 3 quarters of 2022.

After that, I'm forecasting 20% growth in the next 5 years and then slowly decline to the risk-free rate (1.93%). By then, the company's revenue will grow 315% to $22.1b. If we assume a take-rate of 14%, that brings the total gross bookings to almost $158b, which I think is a fair portion of the total addressable market. Let's not forget that the current market cap is $100b, that's 5x my forecasted revenue in 10 years.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question #2 What is the operating margin that can be expected?**

Airbnb operates as an intermediary and if we take a look at Booking, they have an operating margin of 35%. In my model, I am assuming that Airbnb will be improving the operating margin over time and will get to 30%.

&amp;#x200B;

**Question #3 How much will they reinvest?**

I've forecasted a relatively high sales/capital ratio of 4. The reason behind it is, Airbnb doesn't need to invest in heavy machinery in order to grow nor to provide the service to more users. A lot of the reinvestment is already done through their expenses (product development and sales &amp; marketing)

&amp;#x200B;

**DCF valuation**

The assumptions related to the revenue, operating margin, and reinvestment are already provided above. The discount rate used is based on WACC and it amounts to 8.15%.

Based on these assumptions, I got a fair value of $79.9/share.  
If compared with the current market price, it seems overvalued from the very beginning. Let's not forget, the IPO price was $68/share and it is hard to believe that it was significantly mispriced.

&amp;#x200B;

**What if the assumptions are significantly incorrect?**

Let's take a look at different scenarios in regards to the revenue in 10 years &amp; operating margin:

&amp;#x200B;

|Revenue / Op. margin|25%|30%|35%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|250% ($18.6b)|$57.2|$68.3|$79.3|
|315% ($22.1b)|$66.8|$79.9|$92.9|
|450% ($29.3b)|$85.5|$102.5|$119.6|
|550% ($34.6b)|$99.3|$119.3|$139.4|

63,Near-Worthless Stock Advice/Help,"Can someone suggest a way to remove a near-worthless stock from my Fidelity account?  Calling it a penny stock would be an unwarranted compliment.  This was some scam purchase I made 20 years ago when I used to be naive. I'm still naive, but I used to be too.  


I contacted customer service and they said a security has to be defined as worthless before you can treat it as such, ie. just getting rid of it? I asked if there was a way to get rid of it and they gave me zero options, perhaps because they are aware I'm trying to transfer my assets and these shares are making it difficult.  I tried creating a gifting account to transfer it over there, but apparently it's not tradeable or something? I even tried filling out a contribution form and letter of instruction.

There is no way to set a sell order for it.  If I try and sell it for .0001 (the lowest Fidelity allows me to set, it gives me an error about average daily volume cannot be determined.  It wont let me sell it for market or because there is no bid/ask.

82,A Personal Tale of Two Investors,"Enter me, a guy that invests quite passively in blue chip stocks and my best mate who is a by the book investor that only invests in index funds and sector tracking securities.  Read any modern book on investing and the message is clear cut:  Buy and hold index funds over stocks since your return will almost always be higher the longer your investment horizon with the less-than-obvious unicorn exceptions.

So I'd like to share my personal tale over the past 6 months or so where I invested at the peak of the market in literally a single stock which I will refrain from naming and my close friend invested on the same days in the same amount in technology index funds and a S&amp;P 500 derivative security.  

I think it was early/mid October 2021 when I first bought approximately $40K of a single stock in the technology sector.  (Please hold your reservations as I did an extensive fundamental and technical analysis and found it to be a low risk investment in a company that I believe in and who's products I use).  My friend on literally the same day invested the same amount in a major technology index fund.

As we've all seen, the market rose aggressively to the finish of 2021 climaxing in early January.  At that point in time, my friend and I had about $60K in the market a piece.  At the end of January, he and I had lost about 30% of that value (he less than I).  For those more technical, his average beta was also less than mine for what it's worth.  We both DCA'd significantly in our same initial investment vehicles and continued to do so through the end of January 2022.  

As of Wednesday, 02/09/22, he is no longer in the red on his account and I am about 2% down overall.  Looking back, my friend conducted no research, prepared no spreadsheets, and reviewed 0 financials since his initial investment.  All in all, in the past 3 months we've experienced a  30% swing on large cap stocks and, yes, I know this is nothing compared to the 08/09 market crash, but the takeaways are the same regardless.  

The choice to invest in index funds or stocks is a personal one.  I find enjoyment and value in learning about singular companies and investing in them.  At the end of the day, I may do worse or better than an index investor with the exception of those previously mentioned unicorns.  The major takeaways, for me at least are as follows:

1.  The thing about investing in individual stocks is that it does require more work.  You are putting all your eggs in one basket so you better make sure that basket is a sturdy one. 
2. Not losing your head when you wake up to 10%, 20%, or 30% drop in valuation is key.  Investing in a company with strong fundamentals should be reason enough to keep cool and incentivize you to buy more of that stock (or index fund).  If the stock you bought was worth it at $100 a share, then surely it's an even better deal at $70 a share all things considered equal.
3. Dollar Cost Averaging is important for more than one reason.  If compound interest is your best friend in passive wealth accumulation, then DCA is a tool to have more of it at a lower price.  

At the core of these three age-old takeaways is the singular point that all experience and new investors should have at the forefront of their minds.  Invest in companies with strong fundamentals.  If you are investing in an index, know what the portfolio is comprised of.  With the introduction of fractional shares on multiple platforms, you have the opportunity to  build your own index without stragglers (and without fees).  Due diligence and patience pay dividends and I hope that everyone continues to learn and make money from their investing practices!  It's a fun hobby and one with real consequences and lessons that you can easily apply to your broader life and invest in a happier you.

89,"Russia could hit U.S. chip industry, White House warns","For those like me wondering why semis are getting hit particularly hard today.

WASHINGTON, Feb 11 (Reuters) - The White House is warning the chip industry to diversify its supply chain in case Russia retaliates against threatened U.S. export curbs by blocking access to key materials, people familiar with the matter said.

The potential for retaliation has garnered more attention in recent days after Techcet, a market research group, published a report on Feb. 1 highlighting the reliance of many semiconductor manufacturers on Russian and Ukrainian-sourced materials like neon, palladium and others.

According to Techcet estimates, over 90% of U.S. semiconductor-grade neon supplies come from Ukraine, while 35% of U.S. palladium is sourced from Russia.

Peter Harrell, who sits of the White House's National Security Council, and his staff have been in touch with members of the chip industry in recent days, learning about their exposure to Russian and Ukrainian chipmaking materials and urging them to find alternative sources, the people said.

The White House declined to comment on the specifics of the conversations, but a senior official reiterated that the administration was prepared if Russia invaded Ukraine.

""Part of that is working with companies to make sure that if Russia takes actions that interfere with supply chains, companies are prepared for disruptions,"" the person said.

""We understand that other sources of key products are available and stand ready to work with our companies to help them identify and diversify their supplies.""

Joe Pasetti, vice president of global public policy at the chip and electronics manufacturing suppliers group SEMI, sent an email to members this week gauging exposure to the vital chipmaking supplies, according to a copy obtained by Reuters.

""As discussed on today's call, please see the attached document ... regarding Russian/Ukrainian production of a number of semiconductor materials,"" he wrote, referencing a summary by Techcet on C4F6, Palladium, Helium, Neon and Scandium from the troubled region. ""Please let me know if potential supply disruptions to any of them are a concern for your company.""

Neon, critical for the lasers used to make chips, is a biproduct of Russian steel manufacturing, according to Techcet. It is then purified in Ukraine. Palladium is used in sensors and memory, among other applications.

The Biden administration has threatened to impose sweeping export controls against Russia if it invades Ukraine. Russia, which has massed over 100,000 troops along Ukraine's border, denies it plans to attack.

Some chipmakers have been reviewing their supply chains to scan for potential fallout from conflict in Ukraine. One person at a chipmaking company who declined to be named acknowledged that it has been looking into its supply of neon and other gases, some of which originate in Ukraine.

""Even if there was a conflict in Ukraine it wouldn't cut off supply. It would drive prices up,"" the person said. ""The market would constrict. Those gases would become pretty scarce. But it wouldn’t stop semiconductor manufacturing,"" he added.

According to one power chip design startup executive, unrest in Ukraine has caused rare gas prices to increase and could cause supply issues. Fluorine is another gas that has a large supply from that part of the world and could be affected, the executive added.

William Moss, a spokesperson for Intel Corp , said the chipmaker was not anticipating any impact to neon supply.

But the issue is still concerning, because global chip supplies are tight and chip orders are only expected to pick up. Techcet estimates demand for all the materials will rise by more than 37% over the next 4 years, pointing to recent announcements by Intel, Samsung, and Taiwan's TSMC in Ohio, Arizona and Texas.

Neon prices rose 600% in the runup to Russia's 2014 annexation of the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine, since chip firms relied on a few Ukrainian companies, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission.
