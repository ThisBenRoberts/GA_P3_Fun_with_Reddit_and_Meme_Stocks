7,Straddle on earnings report,"I‚Äôve been observing the market for quite a while on how different option contracts react on the earnings announcements. I learned that a rather safe way to earn some 20-40% is by acquiring a Straddle position on a stock that is usually prone to react heavily on earning announcements. 

What I need some advice on is how long before the earnings announcement is a good moment to buy the Straddle. When it‚Äôs a couple days before there is already too much IV leading to higher premiums. Hence, how long before is a good moment? Also, for expiry I take contracts expiring between 90-120 days. Let me know your thoughts pls.",options,1645869812

13,Kinda new and freaking out (Calls expired ITM),"Hey everyone, I just wanted some reassurance on something that happened today that has me biting my nails. Around 12pm I saw that I had about $20 cash left over in my account so i decided to just throw it into a few near the money contracts and see if i got lucky EOD. Basically, I did, and they actually ended up expiring ITM. I was planning on selling and just taking the premium, but I accidentally took a nap and woke up after the market had closed. Initially, i thought I had just lost out on the premium, but upon further research I saw that the contracts are auto exercised (I use TD Ameritrade). Im kinda freaking out because I only have $2k in my account and its all in equities. Apparently I am now gonna have to take on these 300 shares @ 11.50/share. Basically, I am going to have a huge margin balance on my account because i now have to buy these share and I absolutely do not have the money for them. 

Is it possible to avoid the margin call by just selling at open on monday? Is this something I manually have to do? Cant TD just automatically sell them and credit me the difference? If the market crashes over the weekend, am I actually in the shitter? If someone could just explain whats gonna happen and reassure me that I didn‚Äôt just put myself in debt. 

I am kinda experienced with options and understand the math well, but i have never actually exercised before. Thanks!",options,1645838464

I sold one around 3.05pm and literally seconds later was closed out by RH for a net loss. I called Robinhood which said their risk management team did so because of the risk associated with my long calls potentially closing the day in the money and being exercised for whatever million. Somehow when they closed, they did so for a 30$ debit per spread by selling the put spread and call spreads independently even tho seconds ago I sold for a 30$ credit. How is this possible, legal or even logical? I need advice on things I can do and if there is any kind of recourse.

18,crazy risk management idea,"I've been trading options for just over a year and have had mixed results. I've been relatively inconsistent trying to trade going long with options to profit off of price movement. I've had slightly better results going short trading the wheel. I've still been clapped a few times with the wheel because I wasn't paying attention and ended up getting assigned and left bag holding. In these cases, I can only collect minimal returns selling covered calls without risking loss of part of the initial investment. I don't have the means to scrape together the capital to do the wheel in blue-chip companies, and even if I did, I would just lose over the long term if I can't consistently remain profitable now. So, I'm trying to find a consistent option strategy that can reliably get me from a $6K to a $500K account in the next 5-10 years. 

I came up with a crazy idea to sell deep out of the money cash-secured leaps and use the premium to continue following my monthly wheel strategy. I thought it might be a good idea because theta decay would always be on my side, and in a worst-case scenario, I could always roll the contract over until it expires worthless. In the meantime, I would hypothetically be growing the premium collected from the leap while the initial investment stays safe. I feel like I'm dumb and missing something because I've never heard of anyone else using this strategy and I doubt I'm the first to think of it. So, I am wondering what option strategies work best to maximize returns in the short term while protecting the initial investment in the long term.",options,1645824157

Looking back, I realize just how ignorant I was to think I would just keep things neatly organized in my mind and be able to adjust with clarity. Simply put, it's not possible. Taking the time to outline our approach is invaluable, even in the exercise of outlining the approach itself. It forces us to think through in further detail and answer hard questions. 

For those interested, feel free to drop an outline of your trading plan or strategy outline and I'd be happy to provide some general feedback. I'm sure others would be willing to weigh in as well. To make it easy, here's a template for a Strategy Outline that I like to use. 

1. Executive summary. 2-3 sentences overviewing the strategy and it's use case
   1. Example for (Covered Strangle):  ""This is a staple strategy of mine. The setup is relatively simple; however, edge is developed via management and consistency over time. This trade begins with the Cash Secured put, and IF assignment occurs turns into the Covered Short Strangle. This is an overall bullish strategy, with a neutral / slight downside tolerance. "" Nothing profound, but from my trading plan. 
2. Setup. Entry criteria and screening
   1. Underlying selection (what do you look for and how do you filter/prioritize?)
   2. Trade components (assumption, sizing (allocation and scaling), entry point, confirmation TA/FA analysis, DTE, pricing, entry point, etc)
3. Trade management (profit and loss management points, any interim management protocols (ex. short call falls ITM)
4. Historic results or backtesting. (How many times have you actually traded the strategy, #wins, # losses, Avg Win $, and Avg Loss $)",options,1645756379

53,"Advice Wanted: Wheel Strategy on SPY, using premium to buy Shares of VTI/VOO/SPY","What is your opinion running the wheel strategy on SPY and using premium to DCA into either more of SPY or VTI or VOO? 

As an example:

Start with CSP in a Tax Advantaged Acct. (IRA) 
STO DTE: 30-45
Strike Price: 1 Standard Deviation 

Use premium collected to purchase either VTI, VOO or SPY to DCA &amp; hold long term 

If assigned on SPY, sell CC above cost basis, collect premium to purchase more shares until called away and repeat with CSP 

If SPY continues to drop with unfavorable premiums, purchase more shares of SPY using LIFO (Last in, First Out) to lower cost basis

Main reasons for buying VTI: 
1. Lower expense (0.03% vs 0.09% for SPY) 
2. More diversified (Total Stock Market vs top 500 for SPY)

49,Using ZEBRAs to Create Equivalent IRA Exposure?,"I've been toying around with the idea of replicating the exposure of a passive buy &amp; hold IRA with that of longer term [ZEBRAs](https://www.tastytrade.com/concepts-strategies/zebra).

Instead of a typical:

1. Buying the equity/index outright and selling covered calls, and/or
2. Buying LEAPS and selling covered calls

Create the equivalent upside delta exposure with ZEBRAs, receiving the benefits of ZEBRAs: a) static upside delta of ~100, b) dynamic (reducing) downside delta prior to expiration, and c) reduced buying power required for equivalent delta exposure as stock

This comparison was made last night (so the numbers are old since the market moved today), but illustrates the advantages:

|                  | **Debit** | **Delta** | **Breakeven** | **Breakeven %** |
|-----------------:|-----------|-----------|---------------|-----------------|
| **Stock**        |   $42,760 |       100 |          $427 |              0% |
| **1 Year ZEBRA** |   $15,534 |       100 |          $427 |              0% |
| **1 Year LEAPS** |    $9,899 |        75 |          **$449**|              **5%** |

Taking SPY at $427 (last night) this table serves to highlight the buying power savings for the same exposure as stock, and the benefit of no extrinsic value that must be overcome to profit as with a LEAPS.

Also, considering the expected move at a Jan 2023 expiration:

|                  | **Debit** | **-1 Sigma** | **No Movement** | **1 Sigma** |
|-----------------:|-----------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Stock**        |   $42,760 |     -$12,327 |              $0 |     $11,120 |
| **1 Year ZEBRA** |   $15,534 | Management   |             $24 |     $11,377 |
| **1 Year LEAPS** |    $9,899 |      -$9,899 |         -$2,120 |      $9,012 |

Here the ZEBRA allows for downside management vs a buy &amp; hold. If the price reaches the two long calls, one would close the position (which is now a lower delta), and re-establish to reset to 100 deltas. 

Finally, using the ZEBRA to create equivalent exposure in an IRA also allows for the selling of covered calls against the two long calls, though I would venture selling 1 call against the full ZEBRA (vs 2) is a better balance of basis reduction and upside potential.

Has anyone experimented with this longer term in your IRA? My biggest question around execution is how to choose expiration. I'm looking at either ~120 days, ~180 days or a year.",options,1645579121

So normally, short calendar spreads have the same margin requirements as a naked option, but this isn't the case with futures options at least not on E-Minis on Thinkorswim.

So I'm looking at the ESH22 wk 4 / EOM / wk1

Sell the wk4 buy 2 EOM and sell the wk 1

With the vix opening premarket near 31 these looked juicy... the short vega of the short calendar in the back you end up short vega as well as getting positive theta from the front long calendar.

By doubling this going itm and otm you can spread this out nicely with a very small loss at expiration in only 2 spots...but the nature of the p&amp;l graph means that you should be able to close this in a day or 2 for a nice gain no matter where the price moves.

78,Short Call Spreads,"In the current market short call spreads seem to be an appropriate options strategy? Right?

Anyways, just playing around with NDX because the numbers are large and who doesn't like large numbers?

**If** one could get a net credit on their spread that is larger than the spread itself then this is a no lose option? Right? 

So for instance, NDX is around 14,009:

* Sell $14010 Call at $158
* Buy $14020 Call at $145
* Total credit of $13 ($1300 credited to account)
* Max loss at expiration would be the difference between the spreads, or $10 ($1000 debited from account).

So the max ""loss"" of this option would be $300 to the positive? Now I understand that I'm currently working with after hours pricing so perhaps the bid/ask are just completely off but it helps me to understand this a bit better. Do these options strategies ever come out mostly even in terms of max loss? I.e. credit of a $1000 at time of selling with a $10 spread?",options,1645490301

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** was lower by about $8, or 2% last week, less than the 2.5% ($11) move options were pricing. Implied volatility is about the same as last week.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing about a 2.4% move this week (about $10 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** ‚Äì The VIX closed last week just shy of 28. It had a range of about 24 to 31 during the week. As mentioned last week, traders should be aware of the implied volatility backdrop as it has been changing fairly significantly day to day (and even intra-day). What position is chosen when the VIX is near 20 or when it is above 30 can add headwinds or tailwinds to those positions, even trades with short time horizons.

### In the News

Cryptocurrencies have bounced off recent lows but are still significantly lower than their Nov 2021 highs. One of the more high-profile equities in the space, **Coinbase** reports this week. COIN is down nearly 50% since Nov 21. It is lower than its IPO reference price of $250 and significantly lower than the intra-day high it saw on its first day of trading (above $400).  


Options are pricing a move of about 11% for earnings, (or about $21). With the stock $187, a $21 move lower would take out recent lows. In other words, the bearish expected move would mean a new low. And on the upside, a $21 move higher would not reach the $220 resistance level. In other words, the bullish expected move is not pricing a move back to obvious resistance. You can see the difference in probability assigned by the options market at those support and resistance levels.  


https://i.redd.it/9pm1fzd3z8j81.gif

This can help inform strike selection beyond or inside of the expected move. For instance, those that are bullish could target the resistance level for the potential for extra reward beyond the expected move. And for those that are bearish, the options market is *not* putting a lot of weight on the stock being able to hold that support level if the stock goes lower on earnings. Therefore a move lower would be into uncharted territory, a situation that has seen outsized moves lately in other names.

And finally, BTC options are pricing about a 6% move this week, less than the 11% COIN options are pricing, for those that see COIN trade more as a proxy than anything else.

&amp;#x200B;

I am sitting with a case for my university regarding PRIIPS, funds and investments. I am being told that I have a fund, whose PRIIP investment purpose is to invest in a EuroStoxx 50 stocks. The client is defined as having a range of asset managers who ensure that the fund is investing following the funds investment strategy. This strategy is described as ""track the index and have as little slippage as possible"". The fund is using leverage (debt I assume) to ensure liquidity for investors. The investors will pay a fixed fee over the period normalized to the days the investor holds the fund. The fund is two years old and only has data for this period, naturally. The recommended holding period is five years.

&amp;#x200B;

I am being asked:

&amp;#x200B;

1) Is the PRIIP a derivative? If yes, define it as a PRIIP category 1. I have chosen to go for PRIIP category 2, because it seems to me like it is an ETF due to it investing in a EuroStoxx 50 stocks.

2) Are there any elements that cannot be observed in the market? If yes, category 4.

3) Is the return elements controlled by the PRIIP-fabricater? If yes, category 4

4) Does the PRIIP give unconditional guarantees? If yes, category 3

5) Is the value of the investment en constant part of the value of the underlying asset? If yes, category 2, if no, category 3.

&amp;#x200B;

There is also a part called: The data demand confirms hereafter, whether the categorization is to be adjusted:

1) Is the daily data from the last two years? If no, see 5)

2) Is the weekly data from the last four years? If no, see 5)

3) Is the 14-day data from the last five years? If no, see 5)

4) Is the monthly data from the last five years? If no, see 5)

5) Is there a related benchmark or proxy available, that abides by one of the data demands mentioned before (point 1) to 4))? If no, category 1).

&amp;#x200B;

I find this rather hard to wrap my head around, seen as I havent done such a case before. If anybody can assist me in answering even a single question here, it would be greatly appreciated!

I have a smaller account I tend to make some pretty risky trades with. If I get to a certain point I withdraw it and start over. 

On Friday I decided to play SNOW calls.   Everything seemed legit, ended up going south (literally).  Afterwards and All weekend I‚Äôve been looking at what went wrong.      I noticed SNOW has an IV of 83.9.   AAPL has 29.2. For comparison.  Then I noticed that the HV for SNOW was 100% meaning for the last period the IV was lower 100% of the time.

I get it‚Äôs elevated, but is this a decent indicator to stay away  in the future?    In the AAPL comparison it‚Äôs at 70%.  So does this mean less risky?

5,"Have you ever *really* ""blown up your account""? I did.","Two years ago I increased my salary by changing jobs. I sold my house to take this job (mistake, housing has increased more than 50% in two years in the market I sold in).

I got swept up in the last crypto bull run and the Gamestop stuff, I made about 50k in a few months in gains, which was a lot for me (net worth under 500k at the time).

The last 6 months have been brutal. I got into buying call options and just kept doubling down when things went south. I put over $100k into basically meme stock call options with 4-6 month expiries. They were in the money. But they were shit stocks and they have since been destroyed.  $CLOV, $HIPO, $SPCE to name a few. I tried to ""average down"" on call options. Rookie mistake.

My net worth is \*down\* from $805k in October to $630k right now. I feel like a such an idiot. 

I definitely know some of the things \*not\* to do with options.  Right now I am just selling some covered calls but I'll never make back what I've lost doing that. 

I'm still holding some long calls in $CRSR, $SPCE, $LTCH, and a few others but they are all down &gt;%50.  I'm trying to decide if I should cut huge losses and just stop options entirely or if I can actually learn from this and turn things around in time with a more level headed approach.

10,A Strategy Based on Macro Economics," 

Hello -

Allow me to introduce myself.

My name is Charlie's Vids. I made YouTube videos going over the current events of the market last year.

I'll make this as brief as I can - but basically - I've spent the last year researching into the stock market / market policy implementation / market mechanics / etc.

You can find various documents / PowerPoints around tons of topics on my YT channel - but that's not the point.

I'm here to talk about what nobody is looking at, and what I've built to capture this opportunity. I honestly am going insane, because it's as clear as day - but despite that - NOBODY IS LOOKING.

***WHY?***

Because the media narrative, of course.

What am I talking about here?

Well.. please refer to the two pictures below:

[https://ibb.co/64BRNqz](https://ibb.co/64BRNqz) \- SPY 09/17/20 - TODAY

[https://ibb.co/vqTrH7v](https://ibb.co/vqTrH7v) \- MCHI 09/17/20 - TODAY

[https://ibb.co/d28wgqY](https://ibb.co/d28wgqY) Both combined / overlaid 9/17/20 - TODAY

So why are we starting from the 17th of September, 2020?

I'll run through this briefly, and then explain how I plan to tackle this.

***STEPTEMBER 17TH, 2019:***

FED Reserve enters to lend to banks as the ""Lender of Last Resort"". 14 Monetary Policy Facilities and Programs were create to combat the surging Covid19 Pandemic that had just surfaced during this time.

You can find more info on these claims here:

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-and-loan-facilities.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/funding-credit-liquidity-and-loan-facilities.htm)

***MARCH 31ST, 2021:***

The Supplemental Leverage Ratio was in effect from April 1st, 2020 - March 31st, 2021. This basically allowed the banks to free up their liquidity and continue lending to banks and businesses during the pandemic.

The supplementary leverage ratio is the US implementation of the Basel III Tier 1 [**leverage ratio**](https://www.risk.net/definition/leverage-ratio), with which banks calculate the amount of common equity capital they must hold relative to their total leverage exposure. Large US banks must hold 3%. Top-tier bank holding companies must also hold an extra 2% buffer, for a total of 5%. The SLR, which does not distinguish between assets based on risk, is conceived as a backstop to risk-weighted capital requirements.

[https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/bcreg20210319b.htm)

Going back and looking at the chart - you can clearly see the major indexes - not just the SPY - start to tank RIGHT INTO the timeframe leading into the SLR Monetary Policy.

THEN - during this time period - later that year in August of 2020, the ***THREE RED LINES POLICY*** was implemented by the Chinese Government, which was basically ***FORCED DELEVERAGING*** of major developers, likely a major player in the collapse of ***ARCHAEGOS*** that took place 6 months later in March of 2021, just a week shy of ***SLR EXPIRING.***

[***https://www.ubs.com/global/en/assetmanagement/insights/thematic-viewpoints/apac-and-emerging/articles/china-three-red-lines.html***](https://www.ubs.com/global/en/assetmanagement/insights/thematic-viewpoints/apac-and-emerging/articles/china-three-red-lines.html)

More info can be found at the link above.

So Archaegos collapses, SLR enables the biggest players to leverage themselves to the extreme - and then SLR expires.

Well - what happens after that? Now it gets interesting - because now - all of a sudden - the US has been LEVERAGING for the past 6 months, while the Chinese have been ***DELEVERAGING.***

(explaining the overlaid picture above)

There's one more thing that ties into this before I get into the trading part -

***THE REVERSE REPO MARKET.***  
[https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/desk-operations/reverse-repo](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/desk-operations/reverse-repo)

As soon as SLR expired in April - the repo started to surge to ***HISTORIC LEVELS*** not even close to being reached before.

***THIS IS WHERE MY RESEARCH COMES INTO PLAY.***

I know that due to the repo demand being so high - there is ***TONS OF COLLATERAL*** that are being created/redeemed via ETFs. If you query institutional ownership - there's almost 1,000+ tickers with institutional ownership ***OVER 100% -*** likely because they knew they needed the collateral.

***BLACKROCK, FIDELITY AND VANGUARD BOUGHT A TOTAL OF 11,000+ COMPANIES as per their 13GS filed around this time last year.***

***To remind: a 13G is a required filing when a company is purchased up 5% or more by an institution.***

*So* \-

DUE TO THE COLLATERAL BASKETS BEING CREATED , AND A LACK OF LIQUIDITY IN THE MARKET -

***EXHAUSTION GAPS ON THE DAILY CHARTS ARE BEING CREATED - AND SPECIFICALLY ON EARNINGS - BECAUSE THEY ARE CONTROLLING THE MARKET VIA OPTIONS' EXERCISION .***

***This applies to NON-RETAIL STOCKS*** with low liquidity.

The gaps on the MACD created an oblong ""banana"" looking shape on the DAILY.

You think I'm bullshitting?

Go look at KIRK / AGLE / OLLI / SFIX / SPWH / BBIO / CBIO just to name a few.

**I've developed an entire strategy around this, and this is the DISCORD SERVER I'VE BUILT that I feel I should start getting out there.**

I confirmed with the bot developers that this hasn't been done, so please come check it out.

discord. g g/fudstop

I guess I can't post pictures here without uploading, but let me just give you an idea of how I've setup / programmed our discord:

***PULL FILINGS FROM DISCORD***  
***PULL UPCOMING EARNINGS FROM DISCORD***  
***75 NEWS FEEDS WITH FILTERABLE TOPICS***  
***PULL MAX PAIN FROM DISCORD***  
***PULL FIB RETRACEMENT FROM DISCORD***  
***+ several other commands***

What sets us apart is this:

I've organized the discord by SECTOR, and then within the sectors are their respective INDUSTRIES.

I have golden sweeps / dark pool flow / unusual options / quant alerts / setup on EVERY TICKER IN THE MARKET, FILTERED AND ORGANIZED BY SECTOR.

Yes - that's right. I literally spent two weeks formatting and manually inputting every single ticker into the market so we could visualize the sector rotation in as close to real time as possible.

Basically - in a nutshell - US/CHINA has been working together to stabilize the global economy while displaying a guise of ""divide and conquer"".

There's an opportunity out there that's going to miss a lot of people - and it's going to be these chinese ADRs that were spun-off illegally by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley to avoid margin calls from the fallout of Archaegos.

Believe me or not - I've left all the resources for you to go and research this - all of my work so you can fact check my credentials - and I've left you the invite to our discord so you can see for yourself what I'm talking about.

I'm shadowbanned on twitter and youtube, and hated on wallstreetbets and superstonk because I speak the truth about psychological manipulation when it comes to social media - but anyways -  
I wanted to at least give one more avenue my two cents.

If you want to chat more about this - please, don't hesitate. Happy to have a conversation about this with anyone who may have knowledge on these topics.

Thanks everyone.",options,1645392485

14,Replicating bank's investment offer with options,"Hi! I recently stumbled upon a bank investment offer posted by someone on another sub. I tried to translate it as best as I could, since it's not written in English. The offer looks like this:

https://preview.redd.it/6rzmht54s1j81.png?width=1152&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8db08eb3c84450406c10da081a8a54ce4ac2c1

Apparently this is the index that they're talking about: [https://www.solactive.com/Indices/?index=DE000SL0DHU1](https://www.solactive.com/Indices/?index=DE000SL0DHU1)

Therefore, my questions is: Is it possible to replicate this offer using options? For example, using a combination of stock + leaps put + covered calls? I guess that a combination like this would perform well if trades are made in a low IV environment, but what if you want to implement it when IV is already high?

Moreover, I wonder what kind products does the bank use in order to construct such an offer.",options,1645389631
15,Are there realized gains in case of option assignments?,"Hey guys

What happens if an option ends up in the money at expiration and gets assigned? Will this trigger realized gains for the option premium or is the option premium taken into account on the cost base for the shares already?

Will I have just one buy transaction at a price of 150 (= strike - premium) or will there be two transactions, one would be buying the underlying for 200 (and creating an unrealized loss) plus another one for buying back the put for zero (and creating a realized gain)?",options,1645388778

What I'm thinking is even if after you BTC another red day comes or more then you can still wait on a green day and pick the strike that makes more sense then. I also consider that this might be too much work for a strategy maybe more passive. Curious what people think here! Thanks,options,1645355655
33,Most traders underperform to a coin flip day trading bot,"A trader eventually comes across the statistic that 90% of traders fail to make money when trading the stock market. This statistic deems that over time 80%, 10% break even and 10% make money consistently.  Still trading attracts millions of people in the attempt to beat the market and make money. 

To quantify how bad the fact of 90% losing money is I compare it to  a coin flip trading bot which makes a trading decision based on a virtual coin flip *random(0,1)* ü§ñ

Below are the results for 

* Trading $QQQ
* Random enter and exit on 10min intervals
* No stop loss
* Always exit EOD (no hold over night)
* 100 simulations per year to smooth it out

40,I want to make sure I understand a Vertical Call Spread,"I was watching the TD Ameritrade channel on Sling. I have it on as background noise, but I looked over and seen them talking about a Call Vertical.  This will be for a Bullish trade. They were talking about Virgin Galactic ( Symbol: SPCE)  Current value of the stock is $8.40 

The Strategy for bullish, 

Buy July 15th,  $8 Call ( premium I am paying $2.22)

Sell July 15th,  $16  Call ,  ( premium I am collecting is $0.69)

Debit is about  -$1.53 

Breakeven is $9.55 over the next 147 days.  Total Risk is $155 dollars.  Max Return $647

If the price goes up , your making money from the $8 Buy Call. 

But what I am trying to figure out is selling the 16 dollar call. 

Because without the Sell Call the break even is around $10.20, with the Sell Call it is $9.55   Max you would lose is $222 if your expire OTM.  On a side note, if you didnt  have that Sell  Call , then you max profit would be unlimited, so why limit your max profit with making a vertical call spread? Is this mainly for just collecting the premium to lower the debit and also lower the break even price?

This allows us to travel back in time to previous trading days and trade the markets as they were on that day. The tool has it's limitations, but one of the primary benefits is the ability to test different strategies and see how they perform without needing to wait (unlike papertrading) and exposing yourself to the actual market conditions (unlike backtesting).

During the Options Q&amp;A google chat session tomorrow (completely free event for all options traders), we'll be working through a case study in OnDemand to work through how to optimize our use of the tool and test some of our favorite strategies.

54,Calculator for non-standard options?,"Thanks in advance for any help with this.

TL;DR is there a calculator tool I can use or a calculation I can do to determine the break even for my non-standard.options?

Details:

I purchased 200 long calls for a stock with a strike price of $8 at $6.35 per option. They expire Jan. 23, 2022

Since that time, there was a 5:1 reverse.split in the stock. So share price went up 5x

I contacted my broker and they stated the way OCC had adjustmenr to the options was that I now have 200 x 20 options instead of 200 x 100.

So now I'm stuck with  non-standard options wilth low liquidity and their trading price is out of whack with the underlying asset because these options have such low trading volume now.

I'm having a hard time calculating what the break even price of the underlying asset is. It's important for me to be able to set my ask price properly given the bid/ask is so off.

Given the fact that non-standard options aren't  popular, the simplest solution seems to be to execute.

But then I lose all theta value which is significant given that they expire in about 10 months.

The last one was an absolute blast - it lasted over two hours and was a great conversation. We covered options basics, the greeks with a deep dive on delta, option pricing details, trade strategies and portfolio management, etc. Some of the attendees started their own study group and are continuing to meet on the side. I'm really excited about that group and is one of my goals for these. To get people more comfortable with connecting, the internet can be indifferent, these add the human element back. 

These are completely free sessions and just a chance for traders to get together and share information. The format for the next one will be the same. I'll collate a list of topics and create a rough agenda for us to follow. I'm also going to add a small case study for us to work through together, where we'll use historic market data to each place our own trade and review our management at different points. 

We cannot share emails on the sub, so if you're interested in joining in, you can fill out this GForm. (the email in the GForm is ONLY to coordinate the session, I do NOT save them, and erase the form following the session).

73,The Problem with Short Put Assignment,"A favorite strategy of mine is short puts, both cash secured and naked. When trading cash secured puts (CSPs), assignment should be part of the management plan (it can be a tremendous tool). It's common to see newer CSP sellers saying ""they're okay with assignment at their strike"", I sure said it all the time myself. It was part of a self-assuring plan that I had a ""plan"" in the ""worst case scenario"". I liked the stock and if I got assigned it was at a discount to current price, surely I would like the lower basis. The problem?

The first time I had an option fall in the money, and the underlying dropped another 15% below my strike, I suddenly wasn't as comfortable with assignment. My ""discounted"" basis now turned into a premium. I panicked and closed the trade at a loss. Horrible execution. 

Many think they are ""okay"" with assignment at their strike until the underlying dive bombs below it. Ever since that scenario, I was sure to include large drop scenarios in planning. This included truly exploring how I'd feel in the scenario (exposing myself to the scenario before it happens to temper my emotional response and enable rational reactions). I also included different evaluation stops along the way down. Why was it falling? Are there changes in my long-term hypothesis? Am I still okay with assignment. etc. 

This is also a significant reason why I like to trade index ETFs at this point. Taking assignment, even during a 50%+ drawdown is more palatable against a long-term trade plan.",options,1645235362

SPX = 4348

Let's write the ""equivalent puts"" March 2022 puts, namely the 400 and 4000, respectively.  These are almost identically the same moneyness or OTM.

|SPX|4348|4000|34.30|$43,430|7.8%|

I have been put in charge of managing a portion of the family's liquid assets; I manage just under a 7-figure sum.

Level 5 options enabled.

[SPX options are CBOE options](https://www.cboe.com/tradable_products/sp_500/spx_options/) on the S&amp;P 500 index:

* European-style options
* Cash-settled
* The *weekly* options (denoted **SPXW**) expire at the market close, at the value of the market close, on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays
* The *monthly* options (denoted simply **SPX**) expire Friday mornings at the ""value"" of the S&amp;P 500's constituents' opening price a.k.a. the [SET](https://www.cboe.com/index_settlement_values/). 

I'm having a hard time believing this, but I wrote a handful of **S&amp;P 500 index puts** way OTM ahead of Wednesday's SXPW expiry and this morning's SPX expiry, i.e. **same-day expiry each time**. Collecting a few hundred bucks per written option. Options expired worthless, pocketed the premiums.

I'm aware that it's not a sexy trade, but \*THEORETICALLY\* I can do this three times a week and achieve an annualised return approaching 9%. (Yes I know this assumes I do this every trading M/W/F and it never fails, like I said it's theoretical.) If I throw in the monthly option in, it exceeds 9.5% annualised.

The only risk I see here is ""tail"" risk a.k.a. ""black swan"" risk:

* Yes I could get hosed if there is, say, a nuclear bombing
   * Even in this case, circuit breakers *end trading for the day* if the S&amp;P 500 drops by 20%; my options expire that same day, meaning the most I could be exposed to is a 20% drop in the underlying
      * *(Plus I assume that in this case the volatility spike would negatively correlate to the 20% underlying drop and, who knows, might even save my ass?!)*
* But since they're cash-settled, I never need to buy 100 ""units of the S&amp;P 500"" i.e. I never need to have close to half a million dollars laying around (\~4400 x 100 units).

14,Call Buying Hard Truth,"""The success of a call buying strategy depends primarily on one's ability to select stocks that will go up and to time the selection reasonably well"" (Larry McMillian). Buyers MUST be comfortable with this concept. Particularly when deploying disadvantaged trades (short DTE, low delta) long calls, simply because they're cheap. This is a huge hurdle for new options traders to overcome. 

If we're buying cheap calls, we need an even more robust move in our favor to become profitable. This is why most of my strategies are designed to remove some of this directional dependency and include room for error. I have speculative directional strategies (LEAPS Diagonals, Risk Free Spreads) but they are a minority of my overall trade volume for a reason.",options,1645147630

32,Would this Option Strategy be similar to a loan? (or is it just stupid),"Alright, so I've been studying option strategies for a while (without actually trying them elsewhere than optionsprofitcalculator.com; for now I'm just curious). 

I stumbled upon multiple strategies that seemed interesting (CC, CSP, PMCC, Butterfly, and LEAPS are my favorites...). For most of these strategies, you need good initial capital to become profitable with relatively low risk (The wheel would be a good example of that). Hence I'm trying to find an option strategy that would act as a 'loan' and give me the initial capital required to start wheeling / PMCCs or other strategies. I don't know if such a thing is possible, but here is my attempt at it : 

 **- Buying long term (\~2 years) very deep in the money calls and selling even deeper (still pretty close) ITM calls; as well as buying deep in the money puts, and selling even deeper ITM puts.**

This should result in an initial credit and low maximum risk, with a very low probability of being profitable, but this maximum risk would sort of act as the interest on a loan.

With this initial credit, you can then do risk-averse strategies and aim to generate more profit than the interest on the 'loan' to be profitable.

I have no idea if this strategy is even applicable, or if it is just completely stupid / irresponsible and since I haven't found it here yet, it probably isn't. Thank you for reading this anyways!

Brand new to the world of options so I'm trying to understand everything before I put money down.

I'm looking at Realty Income Corp. We'll take last nights share price at 67.44. If i bought 2 contracts, that would cost me $13,488, and purchased the $67.50 strike price for 1 month. I see that the premium is $1.50, meaning $150x2(contract)=$300. So basically if the share price hit $67.50, my contracts would be exercised and I would have received $300premium and my initial $13,488 back BUT I lose my 100 shares. Doesn't seem too bad to me! Maybe I'm just completely wrong haha.

Also, if you wanted to minimize risk. Could you just buy a higher strike price, the $67.50, and a lower strike price, the $65.00. You win either way minus some premium?

Been buying some LEAPS the last year or so, usually at about 70-80 delta, give or take. For most of my trades, it‚Äôs worked out decently. Ford, AMD, AAPL, MSFT. 

However, after what I THOUGHT was a dip in SQ and PYPL I bought some Jan 2024 150c on both tickers. As you can imagine, I‚Äôm getting absolutely pummeled. I‚Äôm down over 80% on both trades, effectively wiping out any gains I made on my other trades. In aggregate the cost basis on these was around 10% of my portfolio - not a death blow but certainly not fun. 

My question is, speaking purely from a mechanical standpoint (ie, ignoring how I feel about the future of the underlyings), what are some effective ways to manage a formerly deep ITM LEAPS that is now OTM? Does ‚Äúbuying the dip‚Äù and lowering my cost basis on the same strike / date make sense? What about rolling up the chain to reestablish delta? With it now being OTM, do I really have a realistic chance of regaining some of these losses?

Frankly, if it were simply a stock holding at a 50% loss or so, I would probably take the L and move on. But with it being an option, part of me thinks the recovery could be viable. 

With my self imposed rule of limiting positions to not be over 10%, I don‚Äôt really have much in the way of alternative trades, and would likely just grab more VOO, so an 80% recovery is not going to happen any time soon on this remaining value. 

I‚Äôd welcome any thoughts",options,1645073353
46,VIX and VXX,"I chatted on a post earlier about these two products. For newer traders, they sometimes seem to offer opportunity for trading range bound movement. Their minds in the right place, however, like most things trading, it‚Äôs not quite that simple. 

Anytime we see something that looks like a ‚Äúsure thing‚Äù or ‚Äúlow risk, high probability‚Äù etc. there‚Äôs a good chance we‚Äôre missing something. The markets are generally efficient, so if you think you found something that offers an inherent edge, you may have. But do yourself a favor and rather than trying to prove your own hypothesis, try to disprove it. This allows a more critical review. I like to ask myself, do I think I‚Äôm the only trader that‚Äôs seen this (when there‚Äôs institutions with countless resources looking at the same things). The answer CAN be yes, maybe we found something that was temporarily mis priced at the right time. But those instances are very rare, kind of like when good fortune smiles on us in real life and we find a Rolex on the ground. 

So for the traders that stumble across VIX or VXX and think they should either: sell calls against it because it always inevitably contracts or buy and hold long calls or the stock (VXX only). Ask yourself, why wouldn‚Äôt everyone do this? Why don‚Äôt you hear more people talking about their VIX or VXX shorting or holding strategies? 

It‚Äôs because these are unique products. They‚Äôre volatility products. VIX is an ETF, VXX is an ETN. ETFs are backed by a security owned by the issuing entity, ETNs are fixed income securities. Their construction is built on futures. VXX tracks VIX short term futures index composite return. VIX is the SP500 volatility index. They both have different dates futures contracts in their construction. As the front month contracts come to expiration, they must roll them out in time to rebalance. This roll typically costs money, due to contango, where future dated chains are more expensive. This process is known as drag and erodes the value of the underlying overtime. 

Volatility products are unique. This just scratches the surface of them. Other important concepts are backwardation, convexity, surface volatility, reverse splits, termination dates, etc.

It was an up and down week; I ended +5.4% on the week but there was definitely opportunity to outperform that.

I took a 7% loss when I closed the /ES position but was still able to in the black.

72,Calls vs. Underlying shares,"I hope this makes sense to someone.

I'll take $F as an example. It's trading at $18 as I'm writing this post. ITM LEAPS strike $15 Jan'24 are traded around $6 per contract, meaning your breakeven price is $21.

If we buy 100 shares of underlying today, that would be $1800, delta 1, $0 extrinsic value.

Intrinsic value of the option contract is CurrentPrice-StrikePrice=$18-$15=$3 per contract, and Extrinsic value is ContractPrice-IntrinsicValue=$6-$3=$3 as well. So half of the contract price is extrinsic value, which will depreciate as we are getting closer to expiry date. Delta for this contract is 72. For simplicity let's not look at other Greeks for now. So $600 to buy this contract today, 72 delta, $300 extrinsic value.

So we're paying 1/3 of a price for more than 2/3 of the delta. Just take a moment here and think about it. 2/3 of potential growth/loss for 1/3 of the price.

Now here are few scenarios that could happen, but please keep in mind that you have 2yrs (-1.5 months) to get it straight, no matter whether you choose to buy the option or shares.

&amp;#x200B;

$F skyrockets to the moon - due to lower delta the price of your contract will be growing slower than the price of underlying, that's how the delta works. As $F goes from $18 to $19 your shares position will gain $100, while your options contract will only gain $72. You could potentially wait for it to expire ITM and get same gain as if it were the shares you bought, but for 1/3 of the price.

&amp;#x200B;

if $F goes down to $17, same thing but vice versa - Shares lose 100$, your option contract loses 72$. If it expires its still ITM and your total loss will be $400 vs $100 in shares position

&amp;#x200B;

if $F goes down to $14.99 and you let it expire, then you must never ever trade anything yourself, you should hire advisor and pay them whatever they ask to do it for you, seriously, you're retarded.

&amp;#x200B;

And if $F tanks much more down to $12 and even lower, than again, your total loss in option contract is limited to $600, while your shares position will suffer for the full difference in the price.  


Another example with high IV, $SOFI $10 Jan'24 is traded at $6.5 (!) The Intrinsic value is again $3, and extrinsic is $3.5 Still not too bad, but we're paying half of the price for 80 delta.   


$AMZN $3000 strike Jan'24 is traded at $670 (!) with delta of 65, that's 65% of delta for roughly 22% of price, meaning if $AMZN decides to drop down to $2500, you're going to enjoy pretty much the same experience, but for only 1/5 of the original price! Isn't this amazing?

After that he presents the calculation of ""Expected Profit = (85% x 1R) - (15% x 2R) = 0.55R/trade""

So to my question:   
The ""guru"" took the 0.15 Delta and presented it as profitable for the seller 85% of the time, but isnt that statistic wrong when you dont let the trade run to expiration? If I were to take the StopLoss of 20%, wouldnt the calculation be in the carbage with much higher loss%?

I have never found a solid StopLoss technique during volatile markets that works (Do you have one?). During slow movements it is possible to close the trade, but often it wouldnt be.

How should I approach this?

1) Selling CCs directly on ETFs like $MJ/$MSOS. 

Or

2) Leveraging by buying LEAPS Calls on the individual tickers and selling PMCC.

$MJ and $MSOS both pay a dividend, so I may be better served with option B, but I'm not sure.

14,DWAC &amp; DWACW Arb,"Let me know what you think about this trade:

Warrants are 1 for 1 common class shares.
100 DWACW @ $27.04 @ close 2/9/22.
Exercise option of $11.50, gives a cost basis of $38.54 per share or around a $3854 entry cost. 

At this point, minus trading costs, you own DWAC post merger at ~$38.54 for simplicity sake, so anything trading above this post merger you are net positive.
 
The trade:

My take would be sell deep ITM calls far into 2022, due to the inability to short pre-merger. 
The September 16th 40 strike calls have a spread of ~$40-43 a contract (The month is just an example). 

Selling this contract in the middle @ $41.50, brings cost basis $38.54-41.50=-$2.96 per share so in the green $296 per contract. 

$296/$3854= 7.6% return. 

So you profit the $296 per contract on ""zero risk"".
Ideally you would want DWAC to trade under $40 upon expiration of the calls, then you would not have to exercise the warrants or the calls netting even more. 

Risk:

The risk in this play, is if you were exercised early on the calls, which is unlikely. If this happened before the availability to exercise the warrants, you would have to get the DWAC shares at market price, likely resulting in great losses. Another issue is whether the merger date gets pushed back, which could possibly have the calls expire before the merger date and this leads to the inability to exercise the warrants themselves, leaving you in the same situation as above. In regard to this there are options as far out as 2024, however the cost of having cash tied up for that long would outweigh any positives of the trade. From what I‚Äôve read the merger is expected in the first quarter of 2022, however I used September as example if there was a delay. The volume and open interest in the option chains is much higher in June or July, making those the more likely strikes to pursue.

26,Implications of Implied Volatility?,"I haven‚Äôt seen anything on this yet and I‚Äôm rather confused. I recently came across options and want to stick with calls that expire at least a year out (leaps). 

I‚Äôve read of a strategy that makes a lot of sense to me, event-driven investing using leaps. The goal being to buy the dip when the market overreacts to an event taking place and plummeting the stock. 

My question is how to do that without being crushed by implied volatility. I know that when a stock price drops significantly it increases IV, raising the price of the option. When the stock rises again, the IV decreases, hurting the option price. 

Is the solution to purchase ITM leaps because its value is mostly intrinsic, where as OTM leaps would be more vulnerable due to it having more extrinsic value? Does that make sense? Am I overthinking this? 

I read of the 2 fellas from The Big Short making a similar play on Capital One. The stock dropped from 50 to 30, they purchased OTM leaps with a strike of $40 and made 1700%.. how was there position not crushed by IV?",options,1644946358
27,My first earning of money on an option,"I made a post last week about selling my first covered call.  I was scared to do it because I had never done it before.  Even though I had read about it, learned about it, watched people doing it on videos.. etc.. for months I built up enough courage to buy 100 stocks and sell a covered call ( I learned better way to do this with selling covered put, then selling covered call if assigned)  

Sorry side tracked..  Anyway my main topic.. I seen the GT took a hit yesterday , a super hit so bad it was unprecedented in the last 30 some years for them.  Because of this it made some news in the trading world that because it lost so much , it created a "" deep value"" as they called it.  So with that being said, I looked at some call options.  I messed one thing up, I thought their earnings was coming out today, it came out yesterday.  But anyway, I had 500 dollars on my TD ameritrade  account. Its just for options..  The value of GT at opening this morning was 16.02 I bought 4 contracts ITM strike price 15.50, premium was 1.05 , so it was a 420ish dollar investment.  My second mistake besides earnings date was, if it was my intention to do a very short gamble, I should had picked a 3 day expiration the premium would had been around .80 I think. I could had bought 6 contracts with the money I had in my balance. Instead I got expiration of Feb 25th.  

I watched the candles go up up up up, little fight and there with the red candles.. but up more..when the stock got to about being 1 dollar over its opening value it started hitting some resistance.  that is when I started getting cold feet.  Its my first big call , risking a chunk of money. I started to plan an exit strategy.  I put in place to sell 3 of the contracts at 1.25 and then one contract at 1.30 .  They didnt go through at first because the trend was going down.. but then all of a sudden it shot up again and hit 16.50 stock value, and the fills went through.  Shew..  

 So yea its not a lot of money I made, came out to 79 dollars and some change. But its not just the 79 dollars I made, its the 420 ish dollars I didnt lose.  Maybe GT will shoot up higher, or maybe it wont by the expiration time I had set.  Regardless the trades are done, cant change it. I made money, didnt lose money,  AND I learned. That is the most important part. 

I also had bought 100 shares of GT outright at 16.10 ( I learned from someone that if I wanted to buy those shares anyway why not sell a covered put and make some premium) Unfortunaley I cant do that yet on my Fidelity account because its only level 1 , my TD ameritrade is level 2 but only had 500 dollars in it.  Regardless I bought 100 shares of GT on my fideilty , and then turned around and sold a premium for .50  strike price at 18.00 expiration is March 4th .  If it hits 18 dollars awesome I just made 250 dollars more.  If not I still will collect the premium and just wait.",options,1644945706

42,Liquidity is King,"I saw a post earlier about someone walking through how they try to enter at the mid and walk their trade by a penny until filled. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this if it‚Äôs a nickel wide product. However, be careful of how wide of a spread you‚Äôre trading. If you need to work hard to enter at a fair price, consider what exiting may look like if things go wrong and liquidity widens significantly. 

I generally use a b/a spread sliding scale based on the underlying price (understanding it will be wider when markets are volatile) but there‚Äôs a bit of gray area and inconsistency in this. 

Another approach I used to use was a % of the strike for a general idea. For example, in SPY, the 11Mar 428P (-0.35 delta) has a 0.07 b/a spread (after hours), which is a 0.00016% spread. In EA, same expiration, the 129P (-0.36 delta) has a 0.30 b/a spread, or 0.002%. I found most in the 10 thousandth range to hold up fairly well when volatility expanded. However, I haven‚Äôt used that approach for a while now so the figure may need to be adjusted to current markets.

I'm even more perplexed by being blocked from doing so because they were very quick to enable margin trading for me.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sUPiE_8Z8-SO0Q20R0JKKILgYP97pI62CtlNW_biM3M/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **$SHOP has made a positive move post earnings around 70% of the time.** Across the past 26 quarters, Shopify has gone green in 18 of them. I‚Äôm not saying that a beat is guaranteed or that profit is inevitable, but the odds are in your favor if you go long. The best way to play this would be to sell an ATM bullish credit spread, as that would net you the greatest return most consistently in this case. If you run binary long calls, you‚Äôd need a large move to break even and make profits, while with a bullish credit spread, you would just need ANY green move to realize max gains. If you plan on running this play, keep in mind that past performances aren‚Äôt indicative of future results.

&amp;nbsp;

- **$FVRR is extremely mispriced.** At the time of writing, $FVRR has an implied move of 18%, yet historically $FVRR only moves 8.5% post earnings. To make matters even more favorable, $FVRR has only moved more than 18% once since it‚Äôs inception, meaning this trade is extremely safe. We can sell straddles or strangles on $FVRR to capture some amazing premiums, and capitalize on the IV crush that will occur the following day. Those afraid of the theoretical infinite loss can look to sell iron condors or credit spreads instead.

- **This week has every reason to be volatile.** We‚Äôve got Consumer Inflation Expectations alongside an Emergency Fed Meeting on Monday, PPI and API Crude Oil Stock Change on Tuesday, Retail Sales, Bond Auction, FOMC Minutes, and a potential invasion of Ukraine on Wednesday, and a boatload of Fed members speaking Thursday and Friday. This is not a week to play the hero, nor is it a week to play with large position sizes. Preserve your capital at all costs.

56,Vertical Spread OTM; shorts filled at 0.01,"I had SPY 430/431 vertical put spread expiring today.

20x options

SPY ended 439.xx.

The SPY 430 expired worthless and is still showing in the account at 00.

But, SPY 431 put was filled at 0.01 after market close.

58,OTM Call Credit Spread Forced to Close,"Hello everyone,

Earlier today I opened a 0DTE OTM 442/443 SPY Call Credit Spread with the intention of letting it expire in order to avoid it counted as a day trade (under 25k account).

However, after close today I noticed that the short leg of my option was bought-to-close at .01 at 1:07. The problem is, I didn't put in this order. First because I was trying to let it expire and avoid a round trip, and second because there is absolutely no reason I would have closed only one leg of my option spread like that. So my only conclusion is that TD Ameritrade closed it for me, but I wanted to understand why when Spy is currently at 439.34 as of posting and never even reached the 442 strike. Did someone decide to exercise my otm short call? If so, wouldn't TD have also closed my long leg?

I appreciate any technical help in this regard, just trying to better understand the computer mechanics behind the broker in this instance.",options,1644874321
59,Questions about selling options,"When I bring up the order in my broker to sell a put option, it says it will credit a certain amount of money to my account. 

How does that work exactly? Do i get to keep that amount of money after just selling it or do I need to buy it back before expiration and then keep the difference(if the price of the underlying stock moves in my favor)? If the option expires worthless and I do nothing after selling it, does the credit I initially get stay in my account? 

Also if I sell put options when implied volatility is really high(like before earnings), how would that affect my options once IV goes down? 

I understand these are probably really basic questions but I wanted to fully understand it before I do something and end up regretting it. Thanks a lot guys!",options,1644873916
60,If 30-45 DTE is ideal for selling CC's and CSP's then is that 20-45 day window also a threat to long dated calls?,"If 30-45 DTE is ideal for selling CC's and CSP's then is that 30-45 window also a threat to long dated calls? I don't really hear that discussed in exiting long dated calls, FAQ's, etc.

I have sold CC's and CSP's and just this year started buying 4-12 month calls, none of which I've exited yet.

I have ASAN calls up 100%-170% at various DTE's and the plan was to exit at 200% on them.

The May20$70 calls are the soonest expiration and are up 170%. SP hit that $70 strike price today. 

I've seen from the FAQs', I can exit partially to lock in original costs or some gains and use other strategies as well.  But if exiting is the only question - is there a time component when it would be wise to exit long calls even if the target wasn't hit yet?

I'm more interested in the general 30-45 DTE question I posed than these individual positions which could easily tank tomorrow.  But I am new to long calls and this is what prompted the question.",options,1644873618

70,understanding theta (in 0dte options?),"Question. I bought a 0dte call on $spy on Friday. It was a silly thing. Way out of the money. Got it for 5$. So I got it on 2/11, the expiration was for 2/16, so I gave myself a little time. 

But after I bought it, I looked at the theta, and it was -.06, which, if I understand theta correctly, would mean that the option would lose 6$ per day. Looking at the option today, it's actually -.07. I don't think that matters though. 

More importantly, I must be misunderstanding theta, because I thought that theta was time decay, and that it signified how much money your option loses per day. But it doesn't make any sense in this context because that would mean that the option would be less than worthless by the end of today (2/14), and the option doesn't expire under Wednesday (2/16), when the option should be worthless.

Does theta apply differently to 0dte options?

For context, I got this option at like 3.59pm on Friday, I don't know if that matters or not...I doubt it... 

If theta doesn't subtract -6 dollars per day from this option, which I don't think it can because it wouldn't make any sense, then how is theta working?",options,1644857129

83,"If the US misjudges inflation, it may raise interest rates as sharply as it did in the 1970s, please don't over-leverage","  

In his previous article, SIULUNG suggested that ""if the US Fed misjudges inflation, it will raise interest rates as sharply as it did in the 1970s"" and that ""stagflation"" was the answer, but unfortunately, the response was ""the US owes a lot of money and dares not raise interest rates"". The sharp rise in the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) in January and the highest annual increase in inflation in 40 years may have fuelled speculation in the financial markets that the Fed will raise interest rates by 50 basis points next month. But many are still very optimistic. Once again, I would like to remind you: don't over-leverage. In my analysis, I have judged that 2023-2024 will be the post-QE era, so we should pay attention to the shocks in the property market in 2023-2024.



https://preview.redd.it/qobufqswfqh81.png?width=545&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d7d6630281c5b134ed868206779ae98bd72a77e6

Source: gzeromedia

And now the US CPI rose by 7.5% in January to a record high since 1982, and the momentum of inflation in the US is still set to rise, especially in food and food prices. The Bank of England's inflation expectations are the reason for this. The Bank of England accelerated interest rate rises, with UK CPI inflation rising to 5.4% in December, almost 1 percentage point higher than expected when the report was released in November. The Bank expects inflation to rise further in the coming months, approaching 6% in February and March before peaking at around 7.25% in April, with the latest estimate about 2 percentage points higher than expected in the November report. The chart below shows that high food prices have accelerated inflation. 

In the past, inflation in the US has rarely been above 5%, and every time it has risen above 5%, the Fed has essentially reacted very quickly and raised interest rates.

The first cycle of rate hikes was from 1983.3 to 1984.8, when the benchmark rate was raised from 8.5% to 11.5%.

Second: 1988.3-1989.5, with the base rate rising from 6.5% to 9.8125%.

Third round: 1994.2-1995.2, with the benchmark rate rising from 3.25% to 6%

Fourth round: 1999.6-2000.5, with the base rate increased from 4.75% to 6.5%.

Fifth round of rate hikes from 2004.6-2006.7, with the base rate rising from 1% to 5.25%.

Sixth round: 2015-2018, with the base rate rising from 0.25% to 2.5%.

If the Fed starts to move, it may do so faster and more sharply than the market predicts. As SIULUNG said, ""If the Fed misjudges inflation, it will raise interest rates as sharply as it did in the 1970s"". In an earlier interview with a financial magazine, Bruce also pointed out that ""whether there will be a similar oil crisis in the 1970s to accelerate inflation, I think so in terms of the cycle.

In the 1970s, it took about 2 years for the US to raise interest rates by 10%.

Stagflation in 1970: The US gave up on the economy and raised interest rates sharply

In 1972, natural disasters swept the world, reducing total world food production by 2.9% compared to the previous year and causing severe famine in many countries.

Stagflation has dealt a fatal blow to the US economy. On the one hand, US industry experienced a prolonged decline in production, with the 1973 economic crisis causing a 15.3% drop in US industrial production for 18 months and the 1979 crisis causing an 11.8% drop in US industrial production for about 44 months. On the other hand, a large number of businesses went bankrupt and unemployment rose to the highest level of any post-war crisis, with the 1979 crisis causing nearly 15,000 businesses to go bankrupt and the unemployment rate reaching a peak of 9.2%, with 8.36 million people unemployed.

From 1979 to 1980, the US inflation rate remained in a vicious double-digit range, with inflation rates approaching 15%, interest rates on US Treasury bonds exceeding 17% for three months, and interest rates on commercial bank loans peaking at 21.5%. The federal funds rate was raised to a high of 22.36%. The high interest rates soon punctured the economy, with GDP growth falling to -1.8% and unemployment at 10.8%.

The 35-year cycle of US debt

The author has repeatedly suggested that the US bond interest rates, whether 10-year or 30-year, have become an even 35-year cycle, which is a 35-year bear market from 1946 to 1981 and a 35-year bull market from 1981 to 2016. Between 1981 and 2016 there was an unbroken downward trajectory for about 20 years, and recently bond interest rates have risen through.

Let's not talk about a 35-year bear market in US bonds, if the rebound in US bonds in the next few years is at a gold ratio of 0.236, then US bonds will have to rise by about 4.6% in 10 years, and if they rebound to 0.386, it will be about 6.78%. Normally, a rise in US bonds would necessitate a rise in the issuance rates of other countries or corporate bonds (i.e. a fall in prices), but if there were to be some sudden and unexpected factors in the market, it would not be easy to see the horror of the shock.

In the short term, the US 10-year yield of 2% is a short-term resistance, but once it is crossed, we can expect the US to collect water and raise interest rates at a faster pace this time.

So we will start in 2022, but over-leveraging will be the last bite of leverage, as SIULUNG said in 2019. Unfortunately, many people have increased their leverage in insurance, bonds and property markets over the past two years. In the future, we should be careful with bonds, the property market and, to a lesser extent, the stock market.

As SIULUNG mentioned in this column earlier, US stocks will fall at every seventh day, and this will also affect other assets.

Simon Smith Kuznets, a Nobel Laureate in Economics in 1971, found that a 15-25 year cycle in the construction industry is followed by an average 18 year cycle in the property market.

With the property market undoubtedly bottoming out in 2003, 2021 is likely to be the completion of this 18-year cycle. Either way, beware of the turbulence in 2023-2024.",options,1644815677
84,Option Theoretical Pricing,"A less discussed but extremely helpful tool is the theoretical price of an option. Similar to using IVP as a gauge of how expensive or cheap extrinsic value is, theoretical pricing allows us to understand if an option is currently trading at a markup or discount. Ideally, we‚Äôd seek to buy at a discount and sell at a mark up. This isn‚Äôt always possible but we can at least make sure that we‚Äôre not grossly overpaying or underselling without knowing. 

Another method is to create the calculations for ourselves. I use both a 30 step binomial calculator and BSM model as well. I most commonly will just use the Theo price from my platform and if I‚Äôm trading LEAPS are a particularly large position I will use my other calculators to verify pricing. In general for shorter dates near the money options there isn‚Äôt a huge discrepancy for liquid underlyings. When trading my Call LEAPS Diagonal however, I‚Äôve come across instances where pricing was off far enough to cost thousands in just pricing disparity. Worth a look. 

I walk through this tool along with a few others in this video for those interested.

92,"Expected moves this week. Palantir, Shopify, Nvidia, Roku, Draftkings and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** was lower by about 2% last week, in line with the 2% move options were pricing. Implied volatility closed higher on the week.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing about a 2.5% move this week (about $11 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** ‚Äì The VIX closed last week above 27, up from 23 the week before. The majority of that move higher was on Friday. Mid-week the VIX got as low as 20 as the SPY topped out near $457 before its intra-week decline of almost 4%.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.5%** (about $11)
* QQQ **3.3%** (about $12)
* IWM **3.3%** (about $7)
* DIA **2.2%** (about $8)

### In the News

Inflation, the Federal Reserve, and Russia/Ukraine headlines continue to cause day-to-day sentiment shifts in the market. When uncertainty reigns, implied volatility tends to make large moves as well. Last week was a prime example as the VIX saw both 20 and 30 within a few days of each other. Traders should be aware of the implied volatility backdrop when entering new positions as that can help inform strategy.

Using SPY as an example, at its peak last week near $457, the VIX was 20. A bearish position placed on that day could take the form of a put spread purchase, or a call spread sale. In the case of the credit call spread sale, the timing would have worked from a delta perspective as the markets reversed lower, but implied volatility spiked significantly with that move lower, adding a drag on potential gains of those short deltas.

Conversely, following a decline and a VIX above 30, a trader can choose between a call/call spread purchase or a credit put/put spread sale to position for a rally. In the case of the put spread sale, on a market rally implied volatility will decline, adding vega profits to delta profits. Conversely, a debit call spread will see delta gains on a rally, but be negatively affected by sharply declining IV.

This is much more of a factor when implied volatility is seeing large swings (as it is now), affecting near-term options in an atypical manner.

\-Are the orders only buy to open &amp; sell to open? If not, how do we know if this contract is being closed or open? Can we look at the change in IV on that contract?

\-For calls/puts on ask can we assume dealer is short and long for calls/puts on bid?

\-So many trades are at the midpoint, is there any way to gauge whether the market participant (not the dealer/MM) was long or short the contract. Would the contract IV change be an indication? Or for big orders would we see an impact on price due to hedging?

\-Is there any way to tell if dealer is net long or short open interest? For example, what would you look at that could tell you whether the call option chain is primarily CC sellers vs. speculative call buyers?

\-Is call/put skew a reliable indicator of the contract demand? 

\-How important is the exchange that it is traded on (e.g. NASDAQ vs. PHLX)?

Suppose you buy -AMZN220211C3100 and sold it at a loss, then you bought back into the security -AMZN220211C3100 one week later, is this a wash-sale?

Suppose you buy -AMZN220211C3100 and sold it at a loss, then you bought back into another call of AMZN at a different strike, is this a wash-sale?

13,Scanning for Options in Small Accounts,"One of the more difficult aspects for newer options traders is finding suitable products. My general preference is index and sector ETFs and SP500 stocks. However, a common thread for beginners is small accounts. This comes with inherent product constraints. 

This video dives into my thoughts and a practical example, below is a summary:
How to Scan for Option Trades for Beginners
https://youtu.be/oonajXtEhVA

Working with capital constraints is challenging early on. I find it‚Äôs important to start the scan by understanding what strategy are we looking to deploy. A cash secured put will have different criteria than a call LEAPS diagonal. 

If I was to start again with a smaller account, my scanning would look a lot like what I do now, I simply wouldn‚Äôt be able to trade most of what I do now.

For scanning criteria, I look for:
-All optionable crossed against weeklies. I like the opportunity to use weeklies when adjusting trades as needed. 
-If I‚Äôm trading any longer term strategies (LEAPS Call Diagonal or Covered Strangle) I‚Äôm sure to add some basic FA views. Free cash flow growth, sales growth, PEG, etc. 
-If shorter term strategies or hypothesis, I focus more on multiples. 
(When trading within a year, multiples make up a larger portion of an underlyings performance when compared to over a year, where it starts to favor sales, revenue, FCF. 

Be sure NOT to chase high premiums if you‚Äôre a premium seller, there‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre high. Find a healthy risk to reward balance. For buyers, don‚Äôt be super cheap with near dates far OTM (low delta) options. These are incredibly low probability and lead to slowly bleeding out.",options,1644730399

Well today we officially saw that trend confirmed, played out and also break a major support line. 

This morning we really had potential and i think some people got trapped when we broke towards 451. But the sellers took over and by golly did we dip üìâ.

We saw resistance near 451.5 tested this morning but it was too much. And after that it was all down hill. We saw support after support broken and eventually a major support of 440.6 get broken. This support level being broke along with the daily 200 ema is an incredibly bearish hint of whats to come. If you remember way back to January. We had this exactly same situation where we broke the 200 but closed above it only for the following days us to dip like crazy.

So we broke support and closed below it and formed a new downward channel what does that mean? Well its gonna get bloody. I fully anticipate this to retest 420 area next week. 

Here are some supports to watch. 
439.9 (daily 200 ema) --&gt; 427 --&gt; 420.76 (bottom of the last dip). 

Obviously this usually wont dip more than 1.8-2% in a day so i expect a rest somewhere near 431-433 before we make it to the 420s. 

Remember my call me crazy but we are experiencing a dead cat bounce from 420 to 458 a week or so ago? Looks like i wasnt so crazy now... if we break 420 i full expect us to end somewhere near 360-380. 

Resistance wise- 443 --&gt; 447 

I do not forsee this breaking 443 though. But it is a weekend and anything can happen. Keep your eye on crytp0 this weekend. They saw a massive dip today too and are at major supports. 

10% challenge today-
Closed one put for 50% 
And one put for 20%. 
https://i.imgur.com/tC2vPZs.jpeg

Positions- 
I was not going to open and hold anything and i even advised against it but end of day when we had the sell off to break 200 ema and broke the major support line... we got a major bounce to 442 and a picked up a 2/18 441P for next week. Im planning to hold next week till maybe Wednesday depending on what we see and how far up its up. 

But remember guys a lot of us saw 50-100% gains today which is amazing and it was a hell of a day for the people in  the intraday discussion but the goals 10%. We just have to know when to hold and when to sell. Its all about risk and not being greedy. 

So for instance if you find the right entry and you find yourself up 20% but supports are clearly being broken... do we sell? No of course not. We set a 10% stop loss (preferably trailing loss) and we let it ride. The whole thing is we ALWAYS secure profits. We dont get greedy and let a a trade go red. 
So for instance if you didnt get a good entry and your trades stalled at 10% . Or even 5%. You don't take a chance and you secure the bag and live to trade again. 

Hope everyone had a good week! See you monday. Again ill be live trading monday like today.",options,1644671656

43,Name this spread,"Was writing about this strategy in thetagang, and couldn't find any articles on it specifically, but I know pretty much every kind of spread possible has a name so wondering if someone here has an idea.

It is a dividend capture strategy attempting to stay roughly delta neutral. Not one I've tried, so I don't know how well it would work out.

Long shares + short call + long put both at the same strike price. I don't think it matters if one leg is ITM or not as much as it matters that the spreads are  as tight as possible and the extrinsic value is as equal as possible.

Closest I could find was a zero-cost collar/hedge wrapper, but I wouldn't call this that because it is less of a collar and more of a covered straddle but long on the put side since both legs are at the same strike.

The idea being for the whole trade to be delta as well as theta neutral so that, minus slippage and such, regardless of what the underlying does the trade balances out, and then just trying to hold as long as you can to collect dividends.

73,Strategy of Selling In the Money Covered Calls,"My account only allows buying calls, buying puts, and selling covered calls so I do not have too many options strategies available at hand. I was trying to think of a simple and efficient strategy for making little bits of cash and decided that selling in the money covered call would be a good strategy and wondered if anyone did something similar or if this was a bad idea.

Using WISH as an example only, I buy 100 shares of it at $2.32 a share and then sell a covered call for Feb 18 at $0.50 strike for premium of $1.90. 

**Scenario 1:** By the end of Feb 18, the most likely scenario is that it is still in the money. In which case I made ($0.50+$1.90)\*100 = $240 and spent $232 buying the shares for a profit of $8. For every 100 shares I am making a small profit of $8 but it is still a profit (commission is nearly negligible for my account).

**Scenario 2:** The other scenario is that the stock explodes and I miss out on large profits. But my goal is to just focus on consistent small profits so I still keep my $8 profit from the above scenario. This is most likely a rare scenario to happen within 1 week.

**Scenario 3:** Then the worst case scenario is the stock goes below $0.50 strike price. In which case I had spent $232 for buying the 100 shares and got the premium of $190 which results in a max loss of $42 which could be lower depending on how much the shares are still worth below $0.50. Again, this is most likely a rare scenario (and I am just using WISH as an example, but it could be other stocks).

If I were to assign probabilities to each scenario, the first one is most likely to happen which makes me think that the expected value of this strategy is closer to a $8 profit. Is there anything wrong with this strategy or any feedback or advice to continuing with this type of strategy for other stocks, not just WISH?",options,1644605388

I hope i'm not violating any rules - did not atleast find anything in the FAQ.    
As stated - Im hoping to find a mentor to talk about stocks, options and to show me some guidance.  Im I have read through a lot of sources but I keep ending up in the same roadblocks. All materials focus on ""terms"" or ""theory"" but lack actual practical guidelines to start up. For just one example I have familiarized myself with the greeks, but in the end all it goes down to ""okay the theta is this, vega is this, delta is this... so what? what should it be to trade this and that?"" - just a very simplified example. Or the same with ""use iron condors when the volatility is low and the price is steady"".how low? on what timeframe? do I set the put 1 or 2 lower of the amplitude? etcetcetc.  
I understand that these concepts are not set in stone and are **far** from simple, but everyone needs atleast a basic framework to get started from.  I work as a medical doctor myself so for me it is identical to a student walking out with all the bookknowledge in the world but no actual practical way to get started seeing patients.  
One roadblock I have also encountered is that everyone is reccomending wheeling, covered calls etc, but as I am taking this as a hobby I am not interested in throwing capital to get 100 units of something meaningful but Im more interested in slowly raising money to get there.

I realize I've made an error by not having a plan. Happily, I've been lucky and my buys, while somewhat uninformed, are up around 100% right now ($GFS and $MU). I just need to decide if I should exit on the general principle of decent profit, or hang on because I'm a long ways to expiry.  
 

As an example, one of my $MU positions:

[https://www.fidelity.com/learning-cente ... ered-calls](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/investment-products/options/tax-implications-covered-calls)  


My take aways and understanding:  


1.) Requirements to ensure covered calls that you write are ""Qualified Covered Calls""  


\- The Calls are opened with more than 30 days to expiration at the time of being written  
\- Calls are written above a strike price of the current price of the underlying stock  


2.) For each day the stock price exceeds the strike price of a qualified covered call, the short term/long term holding period for the underlying stock is paused (assuming it's not a long term holding already).  


3.) For each day the stock price exceeds the strike price of a qualified covered call, the holding period of the stock is paused for the purposes of determine if the stocks quarterly dividend will be taxed as qualified or non-qualified. For a quarterly dividend to be classified as qualified, the holding period for that stock must be greater than 61 days prior to the dividend ex-date  


4.) If you ever write a non-qualified covered call against a stock, which is defined as a call with fewer than 30 days until expiration at the time of writing or at a strike price below the current price of the stock, the holding period of that stock resets to 0  


In my situation, I would like to completely avoid non-qualified covered calls. Regarding the tracking for #3 and #4, is this something people need to do manually or does a broker like Schwab handle this correctly for you in the 1099?

95,My Two Option Strategies if I Started Over After 14 Years,"A common strategy for new traders is vertical spreads, because of their affordability. That doesn‚Äôt inherently make them great strategies. There are lots of drawbacks from poor expectancy, unfavorable risk to reward ratios, and they‚Äôre difficult to adjust. These tend to be more directional plays even if they build in a buffer. They were some of my first options trades and they remain some of the most unproductive strategies I‚Äôve deployed. That‚Äôs not to say there‚Äôs never a time for the strategy but if I were to start trading again it would be with a CSP to a CC. 

If I could communicate with myself starting off, here‚Äôs how I think it‚Äôd go:

Younger Erik: But I have a smaller account and won‚Äôt be able to put many on. 
Now Erik: That‚Äôs not a bad thing. Pick good products (index or sector ETFs, SP500 stocks, etc), and slow down. Theres no need for 15 verticals with $22 max profit and $78 risk. This is a good way to bleed out. 

YE: They‚Äôre slow and boring. I want to make money quicker and learn more. 
Now: Don‚Äôt we all. But the only thing you‚Äôre rushing into is throwing money away. CSP to a CC is a great way to learn fundamentals and limit the stupid mistakes made while learning the basics. Papertrade all the strategies you want and carefully document what works and what doesn‚Äôt for you. 

YE: Papertrading isn‚Äôt real trading, I can‚Äôt learn from that. 
Now: Yes you can it‚Äôll also help teach you discipline which you‚Äôll need to succeed. Treat the account as you would your own money. You‚Äôll learn plenty while saving tons of money. 

The biggest hurdle when first trading is ourselves. Forcing trades because it‚Äôs all that we think is accessible is a really poor reason for a trade. Aggressively save while learning via cash secured puts to covered calls in good products.

Learn to manage puts. Learn to manage calls. Understand how they react in different time frames and against different volatility. Conceptualize gamma. Experience the theta decay curve. Find out how price movement interacts with changes in volatility. 

All these base lessons can be learned when trading the CSP and CC. Not to mention, my 5 primary strategies account for over 85% of my trades. Nothing wrong with learning and familiarizing with more but don‚Äôt let that distract you from getting extremely proficient at a few.",options,1644558707

* Current base position is long (35) 16Dec22 7.5C at $4.27 
   * Total debit: $14,950
* On 4Feb I STO (20) of the 18Mar 9C @ 0.28
   * Credit: $560 
* On 10Feb I BTC the 9C @ -0.82
   * Net debit: -$1,080
* On 10Feb I STO (20) 14Apr 10C @ 0.96
   * Credit: +$1,920
   * Net credit: +$840

Most importantly, I was able to move my short call strike up from 9 to 10 without adding risk. This increases my upside profit potential at no cost (because I collected a credit on rolling the ITM short calls). So although the 9C had a lot of extrinsic value in them that I bought back, by adding time I was able to increase my max upside potential while collecting an additional $840.

My max profit with the 10Cs is +$1700 at the 9 strike and +$4450 at the 10 strike. I could've been cheap and waited for more extrinsic to bleed out before making the roll. I chose to capitalize on the upmove to add upside potential and collect more money up front for it.",options,1644545929

10,Please help with Call Bearish Credit Spread management (earnings)," 

Hi guys, this is the current situation.

[https://ibb.co/rwQM9NC](https://ibb.co/rwQM9NC)

I need to explain my play because I must been wrong someway.

Briefly: this stock is exposed to the macro environment more than others (rising interest rates decrease the loans in real estate) , as to several competitors. More than 100% of $ZG revenue beat was due to Homes liquidations. Stock in clear downtrend. Never recovered from the november terrible earnings.

Technically : I checked the high IV to qualify for call spread (&gt;100% when I sold this spread).

I went higher than the implied market maker move with the short strike, but still.

\~ 1 week to expiration : IV crush + theta decay: all in my favor.

10 points spread seems excessive. The stock was also very beaten, but I think for the mentioned reasons

Currently 22 cents ITM and I'm impressed with the squeeze AH.

I'm expecting this to be subject to profit taking / shorting tomorrow.

As you can see I'm too biased against this stock :) , so I want to do everything by the rules managing it, as I thought I did opening it.

To the experienced guys here.

What do you suggest me to do: closing at open, rolling, what I'm realistically risking if this open ITM for cents, is the near weekend in my favor ( calls for profit taking I believe). Thanks.",options,1644536026

I have some experience in CSP (and CCs) as I have been selling some CSPs on QQQ in my IRA in an instance where I didn't really try to not get assigned as I didn't mind owning QQQ (truly the long term play there *is* to own QQQ).  But, I've never found it difficult to just keep rolling QQQ contracts, both CSPs and CCs. 

What are the holes in this? It wouldn't be a lot of money, I'd be shooting for $200/week (one contract), which currently is around the 0.20 delta. I would never plan to take assignment, I would just roll out and down as needed. Once I became comfortable maybe I'd sell two contracts per week, I have $120k of margin to work with.

Rationale: 3rd trade means my total credit is $0.80, which helps to greatly reduce the loss of call spread from $0.60 to $0.20. and even if it drop and breaches the 3rd spread, max loss is still capped at $0.40.

My point is as soon as I get in a position, I lose money because of the spread, which is between 1.5% to 2%. That's a lot. That means even if detect that my expected uptrend is not gonna go high and I break even on the price of the stock, I lose 2% money on the spread of the option.

Also If my expected uptrend goes high, but not high enough to go beyond the spread, I won't even make any money.

But I still prefer SPY and QQQ due to more liquidity and more options expirations, in exchange for higher expense ratios. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a perfect stock, etf, or strategy all the time, so you‚Äôre always going to have to give up something to get something. 

So am I missing any reasons not to run CCs on both SPY and QQQ? Do you guys prefer single stocks? Any ways to improve what I‚Äôm thinking? Thx!",options,1644423682

79,Wash sales Disallowed even though all positions have been closed for months," 

Hello Everyone,

Quick question. Back in September I closed out of all my positions entirely and never reentered because I had a feeling I created a wash sale on some AMC trading I was doing at the time.

I received my tax statement from webull and it is showing that I have $20,477.25 from AMC disallowed wash sales but I have been out of those positions entirely for months so that should have cleared. Does anyone have any idea why those would not have cleared since technically when you finally close a wash sale position and do not buy back in for 30 days that it should no longer be a wash?

Thanks for any ideas/advice on this.

91,Option calendar days vs. market days,"I haven't seen a lot of discussion on this. My understanding is that when calculating days-to-expiration as an input to BSM, calendar days is generally used until a week or so out, and then market days is used. For example, on July 31 we would say that an August 31 option has 31 days left. But, if it expires on Friday at 4:00 pm, then on Thursday at market open (9:30 a.m.) we would say there are 2 days left (because there are 2 full market sessions left), not 1.27 days (which is the actual calendar days from 9:30 a.m. Thursday to 4:00 p.m. Friday).

How does everyone else here treat that? I was looking at expected absolute movements in SPY and it looks like about 1/3 happens overnight and 2/3 during the day. So technically in my Thursday 9:30 a.m. example above, we would use 1.67 as the days-to-expiration because there are two market sessions left (worth 2/3 day each) plus one overnight session (worth 1/3 day).

And to take this further, at 12:45 pm Friday we would say there are 0.33 days left (because there is half of a trading session left, and a full market session is worth 2/3 days of movement) and not 0.14 days (calendar days based on 3.25 hours).

And, as I'm writing this, I realize that we should also factor in possible movement after-hours on expiration Friday up until the time which options holders have to choose whether to exercise.

Does that make sense? What do you guys do?",options,1644383598

Digital payment are replacing traditional methods like cash, checks, wire transfers and even physical credit cards. These new forms of payment allow users to pay for goods and services, send money across borders, and even finance their transactions (Buy Now, Pay Later). In some cases, the volume of the digital transactions exceed the volume of traditional payment methods

‚ÄúIn the last 2 years, we added 122 million net new active accounts. And despite that spike in new users, our transactions per active account grew to 45 this past year, an 11% increase. And last but not least, we generated $5.4 billion in annual free cash flow.‚Äù

26,Selling deep ITM put leaps,"Dear Gents,

&amp;#x200B;

Could not find exact topic to answer my question, so decided to create one myself.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm relatively new to options trading, so some not usual/common strategies are a mystery for me.

Mostly I'm into selling puts. Usually not very long term, like 4-8 weeks.

However, checked some long term, leaps, and prices of those and ran into one stock, that currently is selling at 14usd, but to my understanding is undervalued and should go much higher in the long run.

So for example, selling 2year put at 30usd strike price, gives 17usd premium. I was wondering, what is the downside here?

If I'm being assigned to buy stocks when the stock is selling for example at current 14usd - I'm in profit (getting 1,7k premium/ buying 3k of stock/ selling at 1,4k -&gt;&gt; 100 usd immediate profit). Only way I'm losing money, is if stock goes under 13usd (but as I said, personally I think its undervalued now) .

Also I can roll option if getting close to the expiration date it seems to not be working to my favor yet.

For some reason it looks too good to be true, there fore I think there is something I dont understand either dont know.

One more thing - what are the reasons for early assignment?

Market outlook is uncertain for the next while, so wondering if rolling into a new LEAP is even a good idea. 

If I just sell and buy the stock I'm essentially accepting a huge loss which won't recover fully just by holding the shares (not that it needs to recover fully, if the risk of holding means it goes to 0)

Just wondering what your thoughts are. I see March 2023 LEAPs ATM for 40. 

So, options are:

1. Sell the 2 Sept 2022 340 contracts at a 50% loss and stay out, eating a 50% loss

2. Sell the 2 Sept 2022 340 contracts at a 50% loss and buy 2500 worth of stock (less than 10 shares lol). Would need to double in value to recover losses.

3. Sell the 2 Sept 2022 340 contracts at a 50% loss and roll out to ATM March 2023 strike for 4k (or some other LEAP)

34,Taking profits early dilemma- Options Alpha,"I watched a couple of optionalpha vids and he was talking about increasing probabilities by taking profits early and limiting risk and profiting off theta

Theory- Lets just say you make several credit spread plays and you make it so you profit from theta. 5 dollar wide spreads 1.30 premium. You create a limit order to buy at 50% profit. That would be 65 dollars. You also place a trade at 30 delta which means 70% chance of success. Your max loss would be 370. 

He used the parable of a casino to say that they rig the odds in their favour to win out long term even taking into account all their payouts.

My only problem with this is if you lose your risk is already defined at 370. Assuming you follow all the rules you win small at 65. Meaning if you lose once you need to win 6 times just to cover that one loser. Doesn't sound like a fair exchange to me.

42,"Using Linear Regression to analyse Nasdaq, beware market crush in March to May 2022"," 

We use Linear Regression to analyse the Nasdaq Index (IXIC). Linear Regression analysis uses past data to predict future trends. A linear regression channel can be thought of as an equilibrium point and a standard deviation equilibrium line can provide support or resistance. 1 standard deviation means 68% of the data is within +/-1 standard deviation equilibrium line and 2 standard deviation means 95% of the data is within +/-2 standard deviation equilibrium line. The Nasdaq (IXIC) is now running at the top of the channel and has only moved through the top of the channel in the last 2000 years, after incorporating 20 years of Nasdaq data. According to statistics, there is a 95% chance that the Nasdaq will move within this linear reversion channel, so be aware of this and be careful.

As we can see, the Nasdaq has now pulled back from the top, so we can watch out for a short period of overselling.

However, we have mentioned before that the US stock market has been in a seven-year crash cycle since 1966 (see my previous article or my book published before)

So we have to watch out for a crash from 2022/3 to 2022/May.

51,Can we take a minute to talk about the rules?,"I've decided to bring this up because I see change in a few areas that I think can better this sub.  The goal is to outline the bigger issues I've noticed become a pattern and hopefully have them addressed.  Given that this is the hotspot for discussing options on reddit, I really encourage you to look at what I cover and provide feedback.  That said, here is what I will be covering:

1. The sub rules
2. The post filter
3. Managing rules

# Sub Rules

You probably aren't reading this but if you are, the overall problem with the sub rules is that they lack specifics.  More so, they tend to repeat themselves in some areas and in others, genuinely hold back what this community has been built around.

**Rule #3:  No off topic or low-options-content posts.**

&gt;""*This is a financial options trading subreddit.*  
A place for high quality community conversation and learning surrounding trading in financial options, and associated markets.  
&gt;  
&gt;Context and effort in your post is required to communicate well.  
Your post and comment should have discussible options content.  
Images and links are not enough.  
&gt;  
&gt;Stock- and investment-oriented subreddits welcome in-depth due-diligence on a company, or strategy without an options perspective.""

Rule #3 - **Issue #1:**  *""**low-options-content posts.""*

\-What exactly does ""low-options-content"" mean?  Context and effort? Because more text doesn't always mean more context and less text doesn't always mean low effort.

Rule #3 - **Issue #2:** *""A place for high quality community conversation and* *learning surrounding trading in financial options,* *and associated markets.""* 

\-You state this in the rule yet rule #2 pushes new traders away.  What exactly does context and effort look like?  Because more text doesn't mean more context and less text doesn't mean low effort.  Especially when we are talking about options.

Rule #3 - **Issue #3:**  *""Stock- and investment-oriented subreddits welcome in-depth due-diligence on a company, or strategy without an options perspective.""*  

\-Doesn't this contradict rule #4 if in-depth DD from another subreddit is passed along here?

&amp;#x200B;

**Rule #4: No spam, no cross-posting, no copy/pasting of post across multiple subs.**

&gt;""We incorporate the existing site-wide anti-spam rules explicitly. We consider cross-posting of all types and copy/paste of posts across subs as spam. Posts to this sub are expected to be *unique* and custom tailored to our community.""

Rule #4 - **Issue #1:**  What is considered to be spam?  There are zero standards laid out for what is and isn't spam.  This also contradicts what was stated in rule #3.  If I write an options analysis on GME when GME is a trending topic between social media (and what I have to say is different) is it still spam?  Spam needs to be defined.

**Rule #6: No low effort posts.  For positions or strategies, provide comprehensive options details.**

&gt;""See the [trade and strategy details guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_details) for an explanation of the level of detail expected option position discussions.  
&gt;  
&gt;If your post is less than 100 characters long, it is probably low effort.  
&gt;  
&gt;Low effort also includes copy/pasted posts from other subs, cross-posting, and any form of spam. Posts for this sub are expected to be unique, non-repetitious, and tailored to this community.""

Rule #6 - **Issue #1:**  *""Low effort also includes copy/pasted posts from other subs, cross-posting, and any form of spam. Posts for this sub are expected to be unique, non-repetitious, and tailored to this community.""*

\-Low effort posts typically get low effort responses if any at all.  Making this a rule and something that a mod can use to remove posts is a liability to the community.  Does an expected standard exist for genuine discussion?  Absolutely, but this doesn't need a mod to manage.

Rule #6 - **Issue #2:**  *""If your post is less than 100 characters long, it is probably low effort.""* 

\-Like previously said, more doesn't mean better and less doesn't mean worse.  If anything, most would appreciate the least amount of text possible to get their point across.  Again, if the post is ""low quality"", the community will treat it that way.  

&amp;#x200B;

Rule #7: Don't ask people to think for you:  provide an analysis, strategy &amp; option position to discuss

&gt;""**Low effort posts amounting to ""TICKER?"" are taken down.**  
&gt;  
&gt;State your analysis of the underlying, general strategy, trade rationale and proposed [option trade position details and exit plan](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_details) for critique.  
&gt;  
&gt;Exemplary model analysis and option post:  
[Rebuttal to ""Zoom (ZM) stock analysis"" with an actual analysis (June 20 2020)](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/hd31dn/rebuttal_to_zoom_zm_stock_analysis_with_an_actual/)""

Rule #7 - **Issue #1:**  *""Don't ask people to think for you""* 

\-If you want this to be a sub where you don't want people to ask about their creative ideas and analysis, then you need to say so.  But the whole idea of having this community is to be able to hear other people's opinions on what you are thinking about.  This ultimately impacts how one will think.  In fact, the communities literally built around this.  Again, this is something the community will find reasonable to answer, not a mod.  If a post is poorly written asking for advice, this community is not afraid to either ignore it or tell them something equally of quality.

Rule #9: **Link-posts are filtered out: no links without descriptions, no memes**

&gt;There are two major posting methods.  
&gt;  
&gt;""**Link posts**"": web page links, images, screenshots &amp; videos. These are filtered and require moderator approval. **Few are released**. Link posts fail to allow detailed description of the topic for further discussion here at [r/options](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/).  
&gt;  
&gt;**Use the ""text post"" method** and eloquently describe in detail what is at the link, and why we may care.  
&gt;  
&gt;Save your memes for another subreddit.  
&gt;  
&gt;**Posts &amp; comments with URL shorteners are banned.**

Rule #9 - **Issue #1:**  *""Posts &amp; comments with URL shorteners are banned.""*

\-This makes absolutely zero sense as to why someone should get banned for this.  You can see the link before you click on it.  It helps cut down on long drawn out posts anyways.  Besides, a ban for this?  Really?

**Rule #10: Not a trading journal:  strategy and other details required.**

&gt;Posting trades, active or hypothetical positions: explain your market analysis, stock analysis, strategy, why that strategy, why that underlying, with full position details, entering price trigger, and exiting net result.  
&gt;  
&gt;[Option Trade Details Required](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/trade_details)  
&gt;  
&gt;Posts of gains, losses, list of trades, trade images without narrative strategy detail, or a repeating series of posts as if you were blogging, are taken down.

Rule #10 - **Issue #1:** ***""****Not a trading journal:  strategy and other details required.""*

\-I don't think mods need to make it a rule to certify a standard for how posts are made.  Besides, they are rarely ever followed.  Posts are made and tailored around the point they are trying to make and making this a rule is silly.  If someone decides they want to post every Monday on their analysis and it's thorough, genuine and meets standards of trading options that this community respects, why at all would this be seen as a problem?

# Post Filter

This thing's standards for what should and shouldn't be posted are standards that are totally independent of the rules outlined.  I have no idea why or how this thing finds certain posts unacceptable but it's a fucking chore to be able to post around it and be able to engage in a meaningful discussion.  If this filter is going to stick around, the standards for it either need to be posted and updated or it needs to go and mods need to manage the sub with new rules that don't constrain the community.

# Managing The Rules

The fundamental reason for this post is because I've seen too many great posts get taken down that clearly were a topic the community enjoyed talking about.  The standard for what is and isn't acceptable is literally up in the air and feels more emotionally led than anything which should be seen as a problem.  I'm all for making sure we have a organized, standardized community but as a mod, you can't call for expected standards when your own standards are all over the place.  If posts lack quality and content then the communities response will respond back and it does--even with the filter and mods.

I'm not asking for anything drastic either.  I'm asking for this community to be managed with a higher standard.  It shouldn't be a pain in the ass to post here or worry about a mod taking your post down without ever even providing a reason for removing the post.

Anyways, I hope this helps.",options,1644282639

-As I understand it, the 1099 provided by my broker only reports gains/losses from closed out options positions (long options that have been sold to close, short options that were bought to close, or those expired worthless), UNLESS they are Section 1256 and already have Mark-to-market treatment.  
-If I make a Section 475 election on equities/equity options, does my broker issue me a different 1099 form that reports a year end consolidated gain/loss, like Section 1256 futures products?  Or do I need to manually (somehow?) calculate profit/loss for each position at the end of the year?  The latter seems virtually impossible.

i had a 25% sell of my options at this price point but decided against it. i think the stock has a lot more to rally but maybe emotions got the better of me.

it is a harder postion because the stock is highly volitile and had better earnings then i expected. 

60% of my orginal stake is already out of the postion but i still have 75% of the orignal amouth of options.

so i am unlikley to make a lose on the postion. and i am still 200% in profit

should i still sell the remaining 15%",options,1644228916

My goal for these discussions is to share information, discuss questions and topics of interest, and connect traders with one another. I hope by doing these periodically we can learn together and sharpen our skill sets. 

We have a mix of topics so far submitted by the community, some highlights: 
-Finding setups for options plays 
-Establishing positions that don‚Äôt require daily management
-Trading methods for small accounts with &lt;$5K (this is a fun one) 
-Ways to measure progress and performance 
-Current market volatility and approach

Yes you will lock in losses but any upside will basically be 2x as much assuming you can buy two leaps with the proceeds of selling ~100 shares. 

In an ideal world you would have cash on the sideline to buy the leap or the underlying stock when it's cheap, but if you just have the 100 shares does this make sense?

4,Trading Treasury Bond Volatility with Options,"Buying/selling volatility on the SP 500 is a well known strategy among traders and there's usually not a problem with accessing liquid contracts to do so (e.g. SPX).  In the simplest case of a ""long vol"" strategy, for example, the trader buys OTM puts to one day profit off a downward volatility spike.  The recession from the first COVID-19 outbreak comes to mind.  In the more complex case, with higher transaction fees and greater capital required, one can approximate the full volatility smirk with an options strip across moneyness levels.  This is by definition what the VIX is.

I want to do the same but also incorporate treasury bond volatility into a related strategy.  The problem is I don't know where to find options on treasuries.  

Are there brokerages that let retailers trade treasury options?

Also, if it's feasible for retail to trade, are they liquid enough to be reliable trades comparable to volatility-based methods for stocks?",options,1644196727

Curious to hear people‚Äôs perspectives on how you would weigh out these two paths forward. Thanks!,options,1644192321
6,Delta as a Probability Approximation,"Good ol Delta. Options traders use it for everything: from measuring premium movements to notional sizing. We can also use it for a rough probability approximation of being ITM or a touch. This is because of the way delta is calculated in comparison to probability calculations. They are NOT the same but they are similar. What you'll find, is in general, for shorter term options (within a year) the variance between delta's probability approximation and actual probability calculations are fairly similar (&lt;10% difference in most cases). 

In the meantime, if you'd like a deeper dive into this concept, you can check out the video I did on the concept: [https://youtu.be/r9U31d944\_g](https://youtu.be/r9U31d944_g). Otherwise, you can read on below.

For example, let's look at AAPL:

https://preview.redd.it/dckq1x10vag81.png?width=1615&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9f53476d274d3eea87e3d8351d1d5c5b6b75b0f3

* This is the 11Feb expiration (5DTE from the time of writing). We see the -0.35 delta 170P has an approximate probability of being ITM (PITM) at expiration of 35% and a 70% probability of a touch. 
* Actual PITM calculation is 36.02% with a 71.03% probability of a touch 
* This puts us at a 1.02% variance for PITM and 1.03% variance for touch

Now, let's go further out in time:

https://preview.redd.it/79twyvxhvag81.png?width=1618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d0671b3241e6485a7fd07e2fb0af47ccb3519ba

* This is the 20Jan23 expiration (348DTE)
* The -0.35 delta 160P has a 35% approximated PITM and a 70% probability of a touch
* Actual PITM is 46.41% with a 83.14% probability of a touch
* This is a 11.41% variance for PITM and 13.14% variance for touch

Using delta is a great back of the napkin tool for PITM and touch, but it's important to understand how it behaves. I have a video coming out soon that goes into a deep dive on how different variables affect delta.  In the meantime, to summarize the primary reasons we see this is a mix of the time premium in the options (attributed to volatility).",options,1644191810

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wKazfWEo2kghgrBU0EjBFqVREhqGyhac-PsQV0LvuIw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wKazfWEo2kghgrBU0EjBFqVREhqGyhac-PsQV0LvuIw/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **Growth stocks may get propped up or annihilated based on general market volatility.** If the entire market is dying yet, *&lt;insert growth stock here&gt;* reports a stellar earnings, it may still get dragged down. The same goes for the opposite. We saw that with a boatload of mega-caps last week. Since this week has lots of wonky growth stocks reporting, don‚Äôt put all of your eggs in one basket. This added volatility adds extra risk to ALL of our trades, whether you‚Äôre short or long, or buying or selling.

&amp;nbsp;

- **Do NOT bet against Lourenco Goncalves.** $CLF reports earnings on Friday, and I expect an insane quarter out of them. Analyst estimates are down, yet last quarter LG said that this quarter will be their strongest in history, leading me to believe that a beat is not priced in whatsoever. The expected numbers are actually WORSE than last quarter, yet the CEO literally told us this quarter will be better than last, setting us up for a surefire beat. To top it all off, there has been some pretty crazy insider buying going on over at $CLF, adding even more confidence to my trade. I know people roll their eyes at this, but around 10% of the entire float is shorted, which may further increase buying pressure on $CLF post earnings. Regardless of if you choose to trade it or not, make sure you don‚Äôt play the short side of this trade, as it‚Äôs a recipe for disaster.

&amp;nbsp;

- **$CHGG has some notable insider buying.** There has literally never been insider buying in the history of the company up until this month, where the CFO, CEO, and Director added to their positions handsomely. At first glance, I‚Äôm inclined to be bearish on Chegg because they singlehandedly ratted out a bunch of my friends in university, but the insiders think otherwise. $CHGG also puts up some pretty gnarly moves post earnings, so if you‚Äôre correct on this gamble, you could be looking at a clean 10 bagger. Similar to $CLF, regardless of how you decide to play this ticker, I would not want to be short.

&amp;nbsp;

- **$LYFT and $UBER provide us with a collateral play opportunity.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you‚Äôre bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter an $UBER position BEFORE $LYFT reports earnings on Tuesday. The $LFYT report will likely move both $LYFT and $UBER equally. If we play $LYFT, we run the risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. If we play $UBER, we‚Äôll reap the rewards if we are right, while also avoiding IV crush. Furthermore, if the move goes against us, the IV on $UBER will inflate, offsetting any potential losses we may experience. This was just a crude summary, and if you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

Lyft reports earnings on Tuesday. If Lyft and Uber both move up AH on Tuesday, would it be better to just buy Uber calls instead of Lyft calls.

Since Uber earnings haven't came out yet and thus more implied movement/more people wanting to buy calls for Uber.

18,"Expected moves this week. SPY, VIX, PTON, DIS, TWTR and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** was higher by about 1.6% last week, a move less than the 2.5% options were pricing. It was higher by more than 3% at one point mid-week. Implied volatility contracted on the week.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing a nearly 2% move this week (about $9 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** ‚Äì The VIX closed last week near 23, down from nearly 28 the week before, and down significantly from near 40 on January 24th. January 24th marked the lows of the recent selloff. SPY is higher by about 7% since then, with the VIX down more than 40%. Implied volatility is still slightly above historical averages, indicating some remaining trepidation about the bounce, assumptions of more day-to-day swings, or simply lingering inertia from the large moves of the past few weeks.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2%** (about $9)
* QQQ **2.6%** (about $10)
* IWM **2.8%** (about $5.50)
* DIA **1.7%** (about $6)

### In the News

Macro news is still front and center, with inflation, Fed moves, and Russia/Ukraine headlines causing day to day sentiment shifts. Amidst that backdrop have been some fairly eye-popping moves following earnings. Meta/Facebook and Amazon were two of the largest mega-cap earnings moves in recent memory. As stated a few weeks ago, earnings during a high implied vol environment can have unique characteristics. From Jan 23rd:

*Options have a harder time pricing near-term events. Earnings are a great example. If overall market volatility is at or below historical averages, the expected move for an event like earnings is almost entirely pricing that day‚Äôs potential move. But in a case where options are pricing potential market moves of over 3% for the week, options need to account for potential market moves in the days leading up to or after the event. A company reporting earnings may see 80% of its potential move reflected in its options premium with the VIX 16, but it may be closer to only 50% with the VIX above 30. There‚Äôs also the potential for outsized moves to the downside on earnings while market sentiment is so poor. This is the ‚Äúshoot first, ask questions later‚Äù phenomenon. Netflix earnings last week are an example. Another effect of elevated vol is that short gamma in the market can accentuate near term and intraday moves.*

Meta‚Äôs move was an example like Netflix, with a massive move lower following disappointing news. But on the flipside, Amazon blew out its results and saw a massive move higher. The options market wasn‚Äôt even close to correctly pricing either possibility, and there was a lot of short gamma in the options market to help supercharge those moves. SNAP also saw a massive move higher, albeit in a much smaller market cap situation than AMZN.

26,Feedback on portfolio risk hedging where investments supply all income,"I‚Äôve built up a sizable portfolio doing options trading for 15 years.  This post is on managing the non-options aspect of being an options trader.   I would like to know how other people who survive off investments solve the gaps that I've listed below.

My ideal portfolio should have the following features

* **Excellent growth** \- already have this covered via options part of my portfolio
* **Safety cash** \- money for near term expenses &amp; taxes, handled via a line of credit and cash on hand
* **Income** \- **GAP** \- Up until now, capital gains have covered my expenses.  I would like to cover 50% of my expenses with dividend paying ETFs.
* **Low volatility investment** \- **GAP** \- This is required to solve the following issues.
   * Minimum net worth security - if I‚Äôm buying a property or taking on a particular lifestyle, I want to make sure that the rug can‚Äôt be pulled out from under me leaving me with no way to pay the mortgage/justify having the lifestyle
   * Dip cash - when the market is in a correction, I need to be able to cash out some low volatility investments to take advantage of it.  The investment should be significantly lower volatility than even SPY

**Background**

* I‚Äôm middle aged and have not earned money outside of my investments for 4 years
* I don‚Äôt have the retirement concerns that older investors might have (eg, small risk appetite).
* I have a call based portfolio where risk is.  I currently manage risk by using a variety of expiries, strike prices, and spreads.  It is not a particularly sophisticated strategy and I have dealt with many huge pullbacks in my overall portfolio.  Down 50% during Dec 2018, and 30% in this recent Jan 2022 correction
* At the moment, I‚Äôm not savvy enough or involved enough to hedge my risk with puts.  Every time I look at doing it, the cost (and time effort) doesn‚Äôt seem to justify the protection they provide.  My success is almost certainly based more on my ability to pick good companies and to manage risk with simple tools and less on my ability to use sophisticated options strategies (beyond basic bull/bear spreads).

Lastly, I don't need X% of my investments in some safe holding.  Instead, I need $X dollars (because my expenses don't rise with the value of my portfolio).

* Income \~ 500 - 800k
* Low volatility \~500k to 1 million
* Cash \~ $50 to $100k
* Options \~ $7 million
* Professionally managed account - $700k (have an account with a wealth manager that I don‚Äôt pay any attention to)

**Gap - income**

My plan is to partially cover expenses so that I‚Äôm not solely relying on capital gains.  I‚Äôm aiming to cover about 50% of my costs and looking at putting around 800k in these dividend paying ETFs

My picks:

* CI Tech Giants Covered Call ETF ([TXF.B](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TXF.B:TSE?sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjk3KHhxOv1AhVclWoFHYR9DvMQ3ecFegQIAhAc&amp;window=5Y)) - \~8% yield plus growth on top
   * I‚Äôm Canadian so this is good for my TSFA to avoid the 15% withholding tax and it is just convenient in general for other accounts
* Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF ([QYLD](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/QYLD:NASDAQ?window=5Y)) - \~ 10% but no real growth
   * I‚Äôm not as huge a fan of this as other people on reddit mainly due to the negative growth.  My investment will deteriorate over time.  I like the monthly payouts though hence I‚Äôll hold a little

Possible addition

* JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF ([JEPI](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/JEPI:NYSEARCA?window=5Y)) - \~8% yield plus growth
   * My plan is for this to basically counter QYLD‚Äôs lack of growth
   * My concern is that I have no idea how it would have fared during Mar 2020 given that there is no data that far

**Gap - Low volatility investment**

For a dip, I‚Äôm hoping I can transition some of my income related investments above to buy so that is partially filling the gap.  In addition, I‚Äôm doing the following

Current holding

* TD Global Technology Leaders Index ETF ([TEC](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TEC:TSE?window=5Y)) - I have a some of this to fill the low volatility gap.  Although it is less volatile than my options, I don‚Äôt want it to be the bulk of my risk management here because it still moves a fair bit.

Possible additions

* Siren DIVCON Dividend Defender ETF ([DFND](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/DFND:BATS?window=5Y)) - This etf is incredible. Look at the pullback for mar 2020.  $33.28 to $29.21 so about 13%.  Compare that to SPHD (Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Div Low Volatility ETF) and it moved almost 40% in the same period.  I almost wondered if they got lucky or made some sort of mistake with the historical data.
* Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund ([XLP](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/XLP:NYSEARCA?window=5Y)) - certainly a good option, but doesn‚Äôt seem as good as DFND
* BMO Aggregate Bond Index ETF ([ZAG](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/ZAG:TSE?window=5Y)) - I‚Äôm not super interested in this.  It only pays out like 2% a year and stays pretty flat.  I find it hard to convince myself to get a bond etf but thought I‚Äôd add it for review in case it is a serious gap.

Any thoughts on my approach to filling these two gaps?  Are there other things I‚Äôm not considering?",options,1644166901

30,Calendar Spread vs. Diagonal Spread vs. Debit Spread for Spec Directional Plays?,"Much appreciated to those that can help me.  I'm going to use AAPL as an example but generally I am looking at this type of question for my moves going forward.  I've had decent success buying pretty far OTM debit spreads and closing them out before expiration for some decent gains.  My only issue is that sometimes due to how far OTM I am buying them to keep costs down, I am closing them for less than I would like in order to keep a profit on the trade because the move takes longer than I had hoped to set up.

With that in mind, I have been reading up more on calendar and diagonal spreads, where I buy more extrinsic and sell fast theta, essentially, without losing the strong delta and vega positivity that can sometimes come with other short-leg component trades (like credit spreads).  

If I think that AAPL over the next few months is going to see new ATH, as an example, and I want to buy the Apr. 14th $175 call and then sell some further OTM calls to walk down the cost basis, what am I gaining and losing with a calendar vs. a diagonal vs. a straight CDS?  

I understand with the CDS I am I am severely limiting my upside if there is a larger than expected move at the benefit of having a secured stop in the amount of premium paid.  The Diagonal is the same thing but has the benefit of if AAPL chops sideways I am short-term theta aggressive so I can make some sort of money even if AAPL doesn't move.  The Calendar is the one I am the most unsure of as I haven't done one before.  It appears to offer a safer amount of risk but at the detriment of tightening the profitable window to the upside, that if you cross a threshold you lose faster than a diagonal.

Is there anything secret I need to also know?  My whole idea is not predictions about shrinking or increasing IV, just purely directional and how can I get the most return out of something with the lowest cost that is still more safe than buying 20 $220 calls and hoping for the best.

45,The Butterfly Factory (Week 1 Performance),"&amp;#x200B;

As a follow up from my post from last week where I introduced you guys to the free butterfly strategy I currently use; I'm back for my first weekly recap of the performance and overall experience through the week.

Total gain for week: +1.88%

This week had some great conditions for the Butterfly Factory. There was decent volatility in the broad market and my entries are ideal when I can time a stock having a rally on the 1-15 minute timeframe. I ended up with a grand total of 23 free butterflies. I am taking assignment on 1 position in AMC which never materialized but it's relatively close to flat. (I trade weekly expirations)

Between the 23 free butterflies I converted from ratio spreads there were 3 which landed near max profit, 14 sold for somewhere near 20% of max profit, and I let the other 6 expire for the credit I received to put the trade on. The strategy is definitely more similar to day trading in the sense that you need to continuously be putting trades on which might be tough for some people that work full time but without a doubt the best feeling as a trader is having 20+ trades on and not worrying about taking losses, just monitoring expected gains. Going into next week I have already opened 4 free butterflies and am looking to get more positions that end up near max profit!

56,Buying TLT Put LEAPS to Reduce Bond Delta,"Hey all, I‚Äôm thinking of a strategy to compliment my leveraged ETF portfolio. 

Right now I have 30-35% of the portfolio in TMF and TYD which I believe is going to get slaughtered during the rate hikes and improving economy. Now it‚Äôs important to not just sell TMF and TYD (3x leveraged 20+ and 7-10 year treasuries) in the case of a market crash when a flight to safety would bolster these shares, so this I feel is an inappropriate way to reduce my exposure.

Instead I would like to ‚Äòbuy insurance‚Äô on these shares by purchasing put LEAPS on TLT (20+ treasury ETF). This gives me less positive delta exposure to bonds but in the event of a market crash and subsequent crash in yield rates the 3x leveraged ETFs would outrun the TLT puts.

Yes it this does cut into my downside protection, but I feel a crash is less likely than bonds getting hammered this year in our current environment, but I‚Äôd be taking a more well defined risk buying the puts.

That being said, I was thinking of 6 month ATM, but wondered if 12 month ITM puts would actually be better.

How would you manage the legs?

Would it be possible or advisable to adjust the put leg in event of a downturn for credit, and/or to raise the strike price?

60,Best LEAPS Criteria," 

I am predominately a long-term investor and use fundamental analysis to find companies that are trading at a significant discount to their FCF and which, I believe, have a lot of growth potential but which are trading at a fair price. I have been using the Wheels Option strategy to acquire stocks at a cheaper price through cash-secured puts and then sell them once I believe they are selling for a premium using a covered call.

Lately, I have been interested in incorporating LEAPS. My main question is what are some key insights for finding the best-priced leaps with the highest amount of probability and profit potential?

For example, if I were to want to buy LEAPS in FB or BABA just as some examples.

Should I buy the deepest ITM stock price that I find? Should I look for the lowest implied volatility? I have heard that we should stick to delta that is anywhere from 75 to 100 for LEAPS? Should I stick to stocks that have been trading sideways (low volatility?) (going down and selling long Call LEAPS?

Would this process be similar for selling Put Leaps? Say I believe a particular stock market is overvalued and I want to profit from the decline in the stock price instead of outright shorting shares. For example, I think with the rise in interest rates and continuous rise in inflation some stocks or at least some sectors will be greatly hit i.e., tech, retail, and companies with bad financial statements (AMC).",options,1644043438

2. While B&amp;H is working, I‚Äôd being papertrading. Younger me would turn away at the suggestion but I really wish I did this. It‚Äôs a great way to learn without lighting money on fire. There‚Äôs no substitute for real trading, but we can get a lot of dumb mistakes out of the way first.

73,Selling index options and implied dispersion,"I'm sure the more experienced trades are aware of the mechanics of options with baskets of assets work, but I wanted to make a small write up to explain how they differ from single-asset options for beginners.

I will begin by explaining the most well-known theory explaining how diversification works, then I'll explain the concept of implied dispersion and how it impacts index option trading.

# Risk and return

I will begin with a very basic explanation of modern portfolio theory (MPT). The main takeaway is that if you combine two volatile assets with uncorrelated returns, **the resulting portfolio will average out the return, but the volatility will be lower than the average of the volatility of the two assets**, therefore your **risk-adjusted returns** **will be higher than just holding a single asset**.

The trick is to then leverage up on the portfolio to have the same gains as the asset with the highest returns yet take on less volatility risk, or to deleverage the portfolio if the risk is too high and still maintain reasonable returns.

Example (assuming interest rates are null) :

&amp;#x200B;

||Year 1 return|Year 2 return|Year 3 return|Year 4 return|Average return|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Asset A|\+10%|\-5%|\-8%|\+15%|\+3%|
|Asset B|\+1%|\+6%|\-6%|\+7%|\+2%|
|Portfolio 50% A + 50% B|\+5,5%|\+0,5%|\-7%|\+11%|\+2,5%|
|(Portfolio 50% A + 50% B) x 1,2 leverage|\+6,6%|\+0,6%|\-8,4%|\+13,2%|\+3%|

Rationally, you would choose the leveraged portfolio if you wanted to choose the least risky portfolio among those with the highest returns. The more the returns of the assets in a portfolio are dispersed (meaning that they aren't correlated with each other, be it positively or negatively), the less volatile the portfolio is all else equal.

There are ways to calculate what the optimal proportion of asset A and asset B is to have the best risk-adjusted returns, but that's not really the focus here and reality is far more complex because past returns don't predict future returns.

# Implied volatility of single-asset and index options

As you may know, implied volatility is a measure of the demand and offer of protection on the returns of an asset. The higher implied volatility is, the more it means that option buyers are seeking protection against large moves and the less option sellers are willing to provide it. In other words, it's a measure of the future expected utility of the option for the market. The higher the implied is, the more market participants see value in the option.

You should be able to see now, thanks to the previous section, that an option on an index with uncorrelated assets should have an implied volatility that is lower than the weighted average of the implied volatility of its constituents.

If the implied volatility on index options is close to the weighted average of the implied volatility of the options on the constituents of the index, then it means the market is pricing low dispersion among returns (generally because a macro event is pulling everyone down or up in the same time). Inversely, if the implied volatility of index options is significantly lower than the weighted average of the implied volatility of the options on the constituents of the index, then it means that the market is pricing a high return dispersion among the constituents. (generally when macro events aren't affecting markets very much).

So when you sell an index option, you not only have to have a view on the implied volatility of the constituent of the index, but also on the future dispersion between their returns, because dispersion can have dramatic effects on the realized volatility of the index if it goes down.

You can find yourself in a situation where you sell an an index option when initially the market expects volatility to be low and dispersion to be high, but suddenly if the dispersion drops (in order words, constituents start going up or down simultaneously), **the index is less diversified than expected and  may blow past your strike even without a volatility spike** among the constituents.

Inversely, if you sell an index option when implied volatility is high and implied dispersion is low and dispersion ends up higher than expected, you can still be profitable because **the diversification effect may be sufficient enough to prevent the index from reaching your strike despite high volatility** among constituents.

*For the more math oriented ones out there, I'm using dispersion as sort of the inverse of the absolute value of correlation, because I find it more intuitive.*

# What does it mean for option selling strategies ?

You should regularly compare the implied volatility of the index and that of its constituents (at an equivalent strike). It's very informative to compute the implied diversification ratio if you have the appropriate tools.

If the implied volatility of the index is low relative to that of the constituents, then it means there are probably more opportunities for outperforming the market selling single-asset options.

In this situation you can sell single-asset options that have high implied volatility and buy index options to bet on a drop in implied dispersion, meaning you believe something will move the market as a whole, but not as much as the implied volatility of the single asset options you chose. This works best for **global macro** investors that have views on the direction of the market as a whole and think they can time these macro events sufficiently well.

If the implied volatility of the index is close to that of it's constituents then it means there is less incentive to sell single-asset options and much more value in selling index options.

In this situation you can sell index options and buy single-asset options that you think are undervalued in terms of implied volatility to bet on a rise in implied dispersion, meaning you believe there will be winners and losers, but the market will move sideways on the whole. This is a very strong strategy for **stock pickers**.

Of course, this requires lots of capital, but overall can both be highly diversified and alpha generating strategies.

It's a reason why I think systematically selling index/ETF/futures options via something like CCs or the ""wheel"" without analyzing the market or having views is not an alpha generating strategy.

74,Day Trade Call,"So I let an AMZN spread expire with both legs in the money.  Normally something I don't do, but it's been that kind of week. 

As a result Fidelity hit me with a Day Trade Call whereby they want a seven figure deposit or they will restrict the account.  I guess the assignment of the short and then exercise of the long was considered a day trade and the total was above my intraday trading power. 

I'm going to call them but was wondering if others had experienced this.  I've been doing this over a year and have never heard of this scenario.  

Note this isn't a margin call.  They are not going to liquidate anything if I don't pay.  They just reduce my buying power for 90 days.",options,1644010899
75,Choosing among trading strategies,"Hi,

As a beginner to options, the universe of strategies is daunting.

If one were presently bearish (months-long time horizon), a single-leg put on SPX or SPY is a straightforward option.

Other than that, what other \*general\* strategies would you consider that limit the downside risk of a (SPX or SPY) bearish trade(s), knowing that such also limits potential upside gain? And, if possible, in order of most ""risky"" to most ""conservative"" ? I know that within any particular strategy, one can make further choices (strike price, DTE, etc.) that affect these trade-offs as well. 

Is any one or more particularly appealing because it doesn't require intense position(s) monitoring or potential position(s) adjustments ?

(I have McMillan's book so I can further explore your suggestions.)

If these questions are too vague/naive, just ignore them, of course  :-)

Cheers.",options,1644006778

In the Black-Scholes formula, the volatility of the underlying is an input in the pricing model. The volatility of the underlying can be calculated through its price movements (even though in reality we don't know what the ""actual"" volatility of the underlying is at a given moment)

However, an option price itself should be fluctuating in time, not only with the price of the underlying but with changes in implied volatility, time, etc. If one were to calculate the volatility of an option price itself (calculated through its price movements) and compare it to the underlying, would it look the same?

14,ATVI: Vol Compression and Acquisitions,"Hey guys, been a while since the last post. Hope you are all are in good health and having a blast in the Options market.

Bottom line first: Do you think the ATVI MAR23 +1*92.5/-2*95/1*97.5 properly reflects the chance that the MSFT cash acquisition goes through?

So recently MSFT has decided to add ATVI in their[mad quest to buy everything](https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/). Currently ATVI trades at a ~16.89% discount to the proposed acq cash price. The part that confuses me is that the butterfly around the 95 strike reflects almost a 5-1 payout if closing on acq price. The crux of my Q is if the discount to Acq and prob of the butterfly line up, or if there is research related to that topic?

Could there be a strategy to enter the MAR2023 butterfly and short equivalent delta to build a pure ‚Äúodds acq might proceed‚Äù play? Vol should be seen as ‚Äúlower‚Äù since an acq is possible, but should the ATVI MAR23 +1*92.5/-2*95/1*97.5 reflect such a low vol? Not too concerned w/ negative carry since the play would be asymmetrical.

So what I'd like to do is trade vix options ie buy calls and buy puts. 

I have a question about the way the vix works, So in the recent spike in vol to about 32 as the high If I bought puts I would have made money, however the options IV also went from 1.5 down to 1.2 a drop of 30. If I am trading volatility then how could options on volatility have their own volatility. I want to trade the directional move on volatility so buying puts when the vix is high should be easy money? Or will the drop in IV for those options negate my profits making it worthwhile to sell options instead. Everything is priced to a tee",options,1643913090

59,Peculiar option behavior on AMZN Calls,"First off, I am not looking for advice on trading options, but rather I am looking for some insight into why this option contract is behaving the way it is. I have never seen a contract act like this before.

The option I will use for an example here is 

   AMZN 2/11/22 3250c 

Yesterday (2/2):  

* This contract opened trading around $30. 
* AMZN stock price at open was around $3060. 
* The lowest dip in option value was around 11:20am when it went down around $20. 
* This coincided with AMZN's dropping about 2.5% to around $3000/share.

Fast forward to today:

* Overnight AMZN dropped over 5% and 
* the corresponding AMZN 2/11/22 3250c dropped over 33% on the open. 
* Throughout today AMZN has slowly dropped 1.5% since the open (share price \~$2850).
*  YET the CALL option has been increasing all day and has gained 35% since opening!

The price of the AMZN 2/11/22 3250c contract right now (1:15pm) is \~$22.50 and AMZN share price is \~$2810. 

YESTERDAY the contract was less than that @ \~$21.50, while the share price of AMZN was at $3000! So AMZN has lost over 6% since then yet my contract is worth MORE??

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON???

Not sure if you can tell but my knowledge of options is very limited, however I have enough experience to know that this is not normal. I assume it has to do with the volatility of the market right now coupled with AMZN earnings later today, but it just seems very counterintuitive to me. Any explanations or theories are MUCH appreciated.",options,1643912677

61,Frustrated,"I started trading options about 2ish months ago and pretty much lose money every single trade. I seriously dont understand what im doing wrong at this point, its like everytime I enter a trade i immediately start losing and the next day or two im down over 20% - maybe someone can help me out here.

Heres my process;
- I usually stick to stocks i know well or assume are someone good like APPL or SPY
- I look at a few indicators for due diligence/research, i look at some news, predicting websites like walletinvestor, and the options volume leaders for the stock im interested in, and previous graphs along with moving averages to get a sense of where the stock may be going
- I look at the current IV and historical IV
- Finally i place the trade, i usually stick to call/put spreads that are 20-30 days out

Cleary im missing something as this hasn‚Äôt yielded any results. Im just frustrated because i know i can do it and willing to learn

74,Conflicted on $AMZN,"This week, I hit the lotto on playing $UPS &amp; $GOOGL earnings. Went from $6k to $145k from Tuesday morning to Wednesday morning. (Not sure if mods need proof, but I‚Äôm willing to provide.)

Now, knowing that $AMZN has lowered guidance for Q4 ‚Äò21 and EPS estimates are NO WHERE near what they were for Q4 ‚Äò20. Adding in supply chain, petrol, labor, &amp; inflation headwinds .. this sounds like a solid thesis for $AMZN to go lower post-earnings. 

But, I feel like $AMZN may have some positive stories to tell in this call. 

1) AWS is a fucking workhouse. The are the Kings/Queens of the Cloud sector so far. Note: Azure &amp; Google Cloud had great earnings last quarter too. Maybe they took some market share?

2) E-commerce ad revenue soared for Google  and Amazon has been seeing gains in that space for themselves. 

3) With positive UPS earnings, not sure what to make of an apparent slow-down in E-Commerce sales this past holiday season. Also to note, UPS probably faced less labor troubles than Amazon. Due to UPS having a large number of Union workers. 

Nevertheless, investors/institutions look forward to positive guidance moving forward. 

We are coming down on Omicron in many parts of the country. In ‚Äò22 , Amazon‚Äôs e-commerce business may not be as fruitful as it was in peak pandemic.

Why? Because these are cheap enough that your Loss is minimal on either end, but potential profits can be astronomical. 

Like, say by a 5 Puts for $0.05 and buy 5 Call for $0.05 on the other end. 

""But Osa! Isn't that just a Iron Condor?!"" 

Yes, yes it is. But I think the point he was making here wasn't ACTUALLY which direction it was going. 

Rather playing off the volatility of low value Options.

A $0.05 Put/Call only has $5 to loose. While a big move can easily see that same Put/Call jump to $0.15-$0.20 on a good day, let alone a big move.

99,Stick to Your Plan - Managing FOMO,"I saw a post that someone was feeling frustrated that they feel they continue to miss market opportunities. We've all been there at one point or another. Some of my worse trades were a function of rushing to try and not miss an opportunity. The solution to this problem is simpler than expected, it just requires some leg work. 

I have a trade on in NFLX right now that yesterday I turned into a risk free vertical spread. The process includes buying an option, waiting for a move, then selling a further OTM call or put. If our credit received on the short is greater than the debit paid for the long, we have locked in a profit and are in a risk free trade. The caveat, we cap our upside. If NFLX ran to 600 my trade would make around $12k, if I didn't cap my upside the trade would yield around $77K. 

What's the point of this? I'm okay giving up a $77K potential for a guaranteed profit (a little over $2K) with a $12K upside potential. Why? The probability of NFLX hitting 600 by my trades expiration (20May) is around 9%. 

I am trading a well defined and tested plan. If we take the time to truly create a well developed approach, test and validate it - we worry less about what others are doing, because we know what we are doing works. It's when what we're doing isn't working that we're more concerned with what others have going on. 

That's not to say to keep an eye open to see what others are doing, I believe in being receptive to new information and potential opportunities. However, if someone else has uncapped NFLX long calls that return $77K - I at no point feel FOMO or frustrated that I didn't also. I'm happy for them and that their trade worked out. I am also happy with my $12K and will continue to deploy my plan.

18,Ideal Strike Price for an option contract?,"Hello everyone,

I've been doing pretty decent fundamental analysis into a few companies and I am quite confident that the stock prices will rise substantially within a year to a year and a half. 

I want to profit from this rise in stock price with options. I am aware of the risks that options carry and I will therefore allocation no more than 20% of my total position to them.

For the sake of this example, assume the stock is trading at $100 dollars and I believe it will comfortably reach $200 within the aforementioned timeframe (1-1.5 yrs). 

My question is: What would an ideal strike price be?

I am considering purchasing call options expiring in Jan 2023 or June 2023. I have also considered shorter time frames with the intention to roll the position.

Obviously, purchasing the $200 strike call would be useless. But based on the options profit calculator, purchasing the 170 strike call has about the same return as purchasing the 105 call. 

I understand that the capital I would commit would be lower for the 170 strike call, but this is irrelevant as I would purchase more of the 170 strike calls to ensure a sufficiently large position that is equal to the 105 call.

So, what is the ideal strike price for purchasing a contract? I want the maximum gain at expiration assuming the stock reaches $200 a share.",options,1643853478

50,"VTI 2/18 $225 covered calls now ITM. Hold and wait for assignment, or roll out to 3/18?","Hey all! Options newbie here (with 15+ years of buy-and-hold investing experience) with a question for y'all.

About a week ago (before the Fed meeting), I sold CC's on some VTI that have been in my portfolio for awhile, $225 strike and 2/18 expiry. My thought was that with the uncertainty around the Fed's plans and Russia/Ukraine as a bit of a ticking time bomb, there would be some sideways movement for a spell and the calls I'd sold would likely just become worthless as expiry approached, basically allowing me to collect premium.

Well clearly my thesis was wrong (at least in the short term), and with VTI at $229 this morning my calls are now ITM. Ideally I'd rather not get called away, though I'd be okay with it if needs be. I have to imagine that if the recent market uptrend continues for another week or two, I'm likely to be called before my 2/18 expiry.

With getting called seeming pretty likely, would it make sense to roll my expiry out to 3/18 at the same strike to collect an additional $2ish per share in premium? I figure if I'm likely to get called at $225, I may as well collect a bit of extra money in the process.

Are there any flaws in this reasoning? As I said, I'm new to options and still trying to learn as much as I can.

58,Macroeconomic Headwinds,"I hypothesize that the markets have mostly baked in the looming March interest rate hike. Looking like there will be four to six this year from the Fed (50 basis point in March not baked in). As each increase is accepted into the market, equities will probably suffer or surge to varying degrees. Not seeing a lot of surge for post-Q1/22 earning beats, however. 

The grey rhino that has recently been gathering steam is the Fed (and all easy money governments) faced with reducing their bloated balance sheet. Journalists revealed shrinking the balance sheet was first being addressed in the December Fed meeting minutes. This is very proximate to the start of the January meltdown. (Minutes released Jan 5, news flows). 

Correlation doesn‚Äôt imply causation, but I would suggest the quantitative easing has led to the Cyclically Adjusted P/E ratio to reach frothy levels https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe. History dictates that these things revert to the mean. Without fail. They haven‚Äôt even finished tapering, let alone shrinking the balance sheet. 

We‚Äôve seen growth stocks with no earnings take the first hit, some down 70%. Historically P/E ratios for the S&amp;P are around 16-17. Lots of great companies with troublesome valuations comparatively and the worst case scenario is they drawdown on interest rate hikes, but get slammed when the excess liquidity leaves the market. 

For example Costco - great solid company - about 42+ today; Microsoft and Apple, holding up entire indexes at 32+ and 28+ today. All of these companies make a mint but why am I investing $30+ to make $1? Easy monetary policy, that‚Äôs why. Equities are inherently risky because future earnings are not guaranteed. The conditions that make them acceptable shall not last. And, I mean WMT, NKE, certainly not trying to pick on tech stocks - all the obvious is overvalued. 

The point of this is that there is an underestimated worst case scenario where entire indexes could drop very significantly - like 50% - where Nike‚Äôs P/E goes from 38 to under 20 (other better-priced stocks will feel less a pinch, but multiple contraction no less). There are also possibilities for a smoother landing. Earnings change and could increase with smaller losses in prices to make more reasonable valuation metrics. However, macroeconomic headwinds forthcoming. It‚Äôs possible, the real economy is much healthier than the markets. I would check your equities for excessive P/Es though, and P/E isn‚Äôt the end-all-be-all; but it‚Äôs indicative. You are allowed to sell high and buy back low again. 

Look how grossly overweight the Fed balance sheet has become. Can‚Äôt see how this doesn‚Äôt have an effect on the sky-high valuations in the equity, housing, and speculative markets. No way this can last forever. The Fed and other central banks can kick the can down the road, but one day these equity prices are reverting.

Happy to hear some holes poked in this theory.

71,ITM Short Put Management," The market is rebounding slightly and offering opportunities to adjust trades. Today (1Feb) I managed some ITM short puts with an aggressive roll in IWM to take advantage. This trade was completely wrong directionally. I sustained a \~14% move against me and was still able to adjust the position and increase my probability of exiting for a profit.   
For a more in depth video recap: [https://youtu.be/Mya8XAdjhCo](https://youtu.be/Mya8XAdjhCo)   
**IWM trading around $218:** On 6Jan - I STO (5) 18Feb 210P @ 4.00. See chart below:

https://preview.redd.it/8vl7ryiaccf81.png?width=747&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=44cce6644773fb32a0702f0986fb1c1713fe0059

 IWM ran below my short strike for most of the trade (and still is). With the last few days of market rebound, I opted to roll the position, for a few reasons:

* I had around $1.15 in time value left in the options. I at times will wait a bit longer to minimize how much theta I'm buying back. 
* In this case, the 210s were far ITM (around a 0.76 delta even after the rally), the probability of these moving OTM is low. A quick look at the probabilities confirms this, around a 25% chance of being above 210 by 18Feb.

https://preview.redd.it/tvac8h6dccf81.png?width=743&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8295ee997c7d7e4982592103632bd7e4fc8b6d29

* I opted to use this as an opportunity to roll my SP while adding some risk. I add risk very carefully, especially in markets like these. However, I've been planning to increase exposure in IWM regardless and have been holding off because I knew I'd need to adjust this trade. 
* I opted to gain exposure in the 4Mar 195P @ 3.94, doubling the trade size to gain the desired exposure and maintain a credit. 
* At this point in time, I'm still around 30% scaled into the trade allocation, plenty of room to expand in. (This allocation includes all current open IWM positions, not just this individual trade). 

**Trade Summary:**\-T1 6Jan:		STO (5) 18Feb 210P @ 4.00 | $2,000 Net Credit-T2 1Feb:	BTC @ 9.50 | $-4,750 debit *Realized Net Loss = $-2,750* \-T3 1Feb:	STO (10) 4Mar 195P @ $3.94 | $3,940 Net Credit  *Unrealized Net PnL = $1,190*  
**Trade Management:**\-First profit taking opportunity is when the new position is trading around $1.19. This is the breakeven point on the trade. I do not intend to exit here, but this is the first profit stop that I will analyze. I will target something closer to &lt;$0.25 (depending on DTE).-Loss management will first occur when K=S. Depending on what that looks like I'll either look to roll, or wait. Much like I did on this one. The initial trade fell ITM 6 days in and remained ITM until I managed today. Waiting can be a powerful tool.-I will continue to monitor this position against the rest of my IWM CS allocation (I have another 6 strikes covered at the moment). I intend to continue scaling into IWM but as I did with this one, I will likely wait to add more exposure based on how my existing positions look.   
I was completely wrong directionally, I will still turn the trade to a profit. That's why I like options.",options,1643773297

79,Ratio spread 2 weeks before earnings?,"Good day everyone, 

A stock is releasing earnings 2 Friday‚Äôs from now, on February 18th. This stock is frequently traded, has liquid options, and usually has a high IV. It is in a niche industry and is a dominant player, so it is usually quite volatile near earnings, and with outlooks being more important now, I anticipate this volatility trend continuing. 

With that said, I planned to buy a straddle that would expire on the 18th. The thesis is that the increase in IV leading up to the announcement will help hedge losses (or even profit) on the leg that opposes the stock price. 

However, I only trade on a monthly/quarterly basis, so I need maximum exposure. I was thinking of buying 2 calls and 1 put. The reason I am so insistent on the put is that overall market downside volatility is still a risk that I cannot discount.

So, after reading this, what do you think is an effective solution?

86,The Butterfly Factory (Option Strategy)," 

This is going to be my first post in what will become a weekly series of posts to show you guys a little bit about my strategy/performance. For some background, I've been trading options for 6 years, selling them for the last 4 years. I've pretty much had experience trading every combination of spread/naked options and had always found most success on naked puts around 45 DTE. I've been profitable for the past 3 years but the level of volatility in returns has been something that drove me to assess my risk profile and how I could focus on minimizing risk. After researching/backtesting over the years I found something that worked; the Free Butterfly.

What is a free butterfly?

A free butterfly cannot be executed in 1 opening trade. It requires opening either a Broken Wing Butterfly or a Ratio Spread and then legging into an equidistant in length long option which effectively converts the spread into a free Iron Butterfly in which you have the ability to profit should the stock price end right above the spread's short strike. The difference between this and a traditional iron butterfly is if you leg into the spread for the correct price, you are guaranteed to at least profit the credit received no matter where the stock ends up. First, we start with the Put Ratio Spread as the opening trade. Here's a PnL model of what that spread looks like and how to enter it. You're buying 1 ATM option, and selling 2 OTM options for an overall credit.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/zuxptdgg2bf81.jpg?width=1280&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3e32d40da45e4ecc7ef55f60fa0c0561e64051d9

Let's say your ratio put spread looks like this:

\-Buy 1 ATM 100 strike put @ 3.50 debit

\-Sell 2 ATM 99 strike puts @ 3.00 credit

\-This results in the trade being put on for 2.50 credit.

What's the last step?

You've put the trade on for 2.50 credit and in order to create the free butterfly you're going to need to purchase an OTM long put option which is equidistant from the initial strikes of the ratio spread. (If your ratio is the 100/99 strikes, you'll need to purchase the 98 strike put for less than the 2.50 credit you received to put the trade on. If you can purchase the 98 strike put for less than 2.50 you've converted your position into a riskless butterfly. Your minimum profit will be however much of a credit you have left after purchasing the final leg (Purchase the 98 strike put for 2.30, you're left with .20 in credit that becomes the minimum you'll make on the trade no matter where the stock goes. There's also a max profit zone right above your short strike where you can make up to the distance of your strikes in profit. In this case the strikes are $1 away from eachother, and therefore your max profit will be $100 + your credit left over after converting to a free butterfly.

The beautiful thing about this trade other than the fact that you can limit any downside exposure and still have opportunity to profit is that if you can screen for favorable prices on the option chain you can expedite how fast you're able to remove your risk. Below is a screenshot from my brokerage account trade history showing you how I entered a ratio spread with very favorable prices and was able to convert it to a Free Butterfly in 22 seconds! Every week I'll be putting a recap of the week to show how my Butterfly Factory is doing! Hope this can help anyone looking to manage their risk or just overall learn about why options are so awesome when you understand the mechanics.

7,EA Earnings - Need Assistance with Trade Structure,"I'm a bit new to options and I need help with the best way to structure my trade to best profit from the upcoming earnings announcement. A bit late in the day - but I still think there's some value so long as the trades are placed before the end of trading today. 

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my prediction: 

EA will miss on revenue mostly due to poor sales of Battlefield 2042 during the holiday season. There's already some rumors circulating that sales were poor and that there were quite a few requests for refunds. This article covers the bulk of what I'm saying but take it with a heaping mound of salt - just like most gaming related news: [https://ftw.usatoday.com/2022/01/ea-disappointed-battlefield-2042-free](https://ftw.usatoday.com/2022/01/ea-disappointed-battlefield-2042-free)  .  I think the setup will be similar to what happened to EA's stock price after Q4 2019 earnings came out.  However, there is a wildcard that gaming companies are being bought out left and right - so a buyout announcement would totally destroy this trade. (Just my lay opinion)

So I suppose puts would be the way to go. But they are of course super pricey due to general high IV of the turbulent market and because earnings are today. Is this the time to use spreads? Sell some OTM puts and then buy ITM puts? Complicating things further is that EA is already down about 2% today so puts are even more expensive. 

Also - how far away should my expirations be when playing an earnings announcement? Should they just be for this week? I have no idea about the long term prospects of this company so I don't have any care to be long or short after tomorrow. 

I'd welcome any opinions on trade structure or my prediction.",options,1643739766

10,The Most Important Part of Every Trade,"The other day I was listening to an options podcast when the guest said something that really stood out to me.

# ""... anytime there's a story for why something is a good trade that doesn't have any component of what the price of the trade is, you gotta have some questions""

Consider a covered call.

A covered call caps the trader's gains ‚Äî¬†the stock is called away at the strike price, so the trader gives up any potential gains above that strike. However, they get a premium in return, which is nice to have when the stock is flat or down. They give up some of their upside in return for a premium. But how much premium would make it worthwhile?

Imagine giving away covered calls for free. Why would anyone do that? Call sellers would miss out if the stock rallied for no compensation. At the same time, if the premium was $500 (SPY $440 as of writing), traders could sell calls and make money even if SPY went to $0.

Selling a SPY call that costs $500 is great while giving away a call is horrible. We know that somewhere between $500 and $0 is a price where being short SPY calls go from good to bad.

Our job as traders is to figure out what that price is. This is why understanding options pricing is crucial for success.

# How much is an option worth?

If a coin flip paid $10 if you won, how much would you pay to play? Most people wouldn't play the game if they expected to lose money over the long run. At the same time, nobody would host the game if they expected to lose money either. We can say the fair value of the game is when both the host and the player break even.

Most people are familiar with the binary expected value formula, which is just the probability of winning multiplied by the amount won, minus the probability of loss multiplied by the amount lost.

[The Expected Value Formula](https://preview.redd.it/si2zpi45z8f81.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ad433ba4bad4fb4e6b9565e36db0a30478677449)

In the coin flip game, you'd win $10 half the time, and you pay to play every time. You would break even if you paid $5 for each coin flip ‚Äî the EV of that game would be $0.

We can apply the basic idea of this to find the expected value of our option.

Some light math. Take (Pw \* W).

* Our ""winnings"" W for a call is the stock price (when we are in the money) minus the strike price.
* So, instead of (Pw \* W), we will have \[Pw \* ( Stock price if ITM - Strike)
* This can become (Pw \* Stock price if ITM) - (Pw \* Strike).

That's what the Black Scholes is. You don't have to understand the equation, just what it describes. This is the formula for a call option.

[The BSM tells us what the probability of winning and the size of wins are](https://preview.redd.it/lcf8ujr7z8f81.png?width=1150&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ae8000ae54242f36009a85c8952fee651aaf5a59)

**The Black Scholes tells us what the fair value of the option is.**

Since the Black Scholes tells us our expected wins, we have to pay that much in premium so that the expected value is 0.

# Implied Volatility = Price

We know the strike price of the option. We know the time to expiration. But we need to know two other things:

* The probability of winning (How often the stock will be ITM)
* The **average** amount we win (since we don‚Äôt win the same amount every time)

W**hat determines the probability that an option will be in the money? Volatility.**

If a stock only wiggles between $100 and $101, a $105 call option is not going to be in the money pretty much ever. A stock that swings between $80 and $120? That $105 call option is going to be in the money quite often. We can describe the probability of profit as a function of volatility.

**What determines the average amount we make when we win? Yep. Volatility.**

If a stock swings between $80 and $120, the $105 call could make up to $15.  If a stock swings between $50 and $150? That same call could make up to $45. Because options don't have to be exercised, higher volatility means we can win bigger but we can't lose bigger than the premium. We can describe the average amount we win as a function of volatility.

*We can see that as volatility increases, the expected probability of profit and the amount we profit increase. With the Black-Scholes, we can look at option prices in volatility rather than in dollars.*

**Implied volatility** is the level of volatility that justifies the market price of the option. If the stock volatility was the same as implied volatility, a trader buying an option can expect to break even on average.

**What happens when we think implied volatility is too low?**

* If implied volatility is too low, that means the option price is too low. If the actual volatility of the stock is higher than implied volatility, The expected winnings from owning the option are greater than the premium a trader has to pay for it.

**What happens when we think implied volatility is too high?**

* If implied volatility is too high, that means option prices are too high. The premium a buyer would pay is greater than the expected winnings from owning the options. Selling options become profitable at this time.

# How does this work in practice?

Say there's a $100 stock where the weekly ATM call is trading for $3. Plugging that into a calculator, we see the option price implies a volatility of 47.9%

https://preview.redd.it/w53mnwrkz8f81.png?width=1305&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=85335ef3a6ec17157c888a898c93ecd227060d50

Let's say that we know the volatility will actually be 80%. Maybe everyone just collectively forgot about tomorrow's earnings call, or a friend's telescope saw an asteroid heading towards the company headquarters that nobody noticed. What's the fair value of the call?

https://preview.redd.it/a61i6x2nz8f81.png?width=1308&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34f05e067e2e7daadc4447e587c44078634da29a

We can see the fair value of the call is $5.78. Do we sell covered calls? No! Selling these calls would cost us $5.78 on average due to assignment. We don't want to be selling them for $3 unless we knew the stock price was headed downwards.

And if we knew the stock was headed down in a really volatile way, covered calls would be a bad trade because our shares lose more money than the call makes.

Before making a trade, make sure that you're getting paid enough (or you're paying little enough) for your trade. For example, SPY covered calls are generally profitable as options tend to be overpriced.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/d7fzvudoz8f81.png?width=1672&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=68b254eedb34eea879abfc4a4d2d76c82f220863

However, we can do better than systematically selling SPY options. 

For example, as I'm writing this, SPY options have an IV of 23.79. Someone might see 23.79 IV and think ""SPY IV rank is high, implied volatility is high, I'm getting a lot of premium. Let's sell.""

However, realized volatility might be more than that. Selling covered calls right now might have a *negative* expected value because we're still not getting enough premium. Calls could potentially be *underpriced right now.*

[Forecasted SPY volatility is higher than implied volatility.](https://preview.redd.it/rgfrbm0wz8f81.png?width=1399&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f5b10cbf8327e375035f36483fd83e7e3bfa813c)

52,SPY Monday January 31st recap,"Mondays have a way of setting the tone for the week and it looks like that tone is bullish for now. 

Today we saw an early morning dip near 439 to retest support of the bullish support line from friday until we went off to the races. 

Power hour brought us the rejection, bear trap and then breaking of major support (red dotted channel) all within 1 hour. This week has a lot of bullish catalyst with earnings expected from google, meta and amazon. My full anticipation is this week continues on a bullish run. 

Now that we have officially broken the 448 resistance and broken out of this channel. 
https://i.imgur.com/AGG5cSS.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/AGG5cSS.jpeg

So now that we broke this channel im going to be looking at the solid white line as support going forward this week. The last downward resistance line from this January dip will be right around 460. 

The one thing im watching closely is the 30 min RSI. Which is running very hot near 69-72 today. Mind you SPY can run extremely over bought with an RSI as hot as 80 every now and then but this is the hottest and most sustained RSI we have seen since December. 

We closed today at 449.91. There is still some major resistance lines to break on the daily when we look at the EMAs. 
https://i.imgur.com/QAD0ef9.jpeg

Resistance this week to break. 
451.5 (20 ema)
454 (100 ema)
457.5 (50 ema)
460 (blue dotted resistance line from 1/3 and 1/13.)

When it comes to resistance i suspect 451.5 and 460 to be our major hurdles. If we break 460s I suspect we go on a tear towards 480. 

Support wise this week
442.5 (5 ema daily)
438.5 (200 ema)
428 (support line from 1/24, 1/28). 

Whats the play this week?
I would look for an entry for some 7-14 dte calls to hold through the week now that we broke 448. We should be headed towards 460 before we see more downside. 

Unfortunately i will be working all week and sleeping during the day till power hour and i dont trust spy enough to just hold a call without being able to watch it the whole time. Spy likes to just dump for no absolutely reason at all. So ill look for some good plays during power hour for some quick 10-20% gains. 

Once we make it through earnings week and we see a test of the 460 resistance i will feel more comfortable going long on some puts or calls but until then this is gonna be volatile. 

IV for spy appears to have come down compared to last week thankfully but i suspect once earnings starts to pop off this week that we see that increase again. 

Remember when you enter your call or put. Wait for a good double tap. SPY absolutely loves to double Tap support or resistance before its next move up or down. When you finally enter make sure you have an exit plan if it goes your way and if it doesnt. 

Dont be greedy. 20% is a very great intraday gain if you cam get it.

60,Systematic portfolio hedging discussion,"1. The portfolio:

I am looking to design a system/plan to hedge a diversified portfolio with roughly the following holdings:

Global equity(US dominant): 40%

EU Equity: 20%

REITs: 12.5%

Commodities: 12.5%

Bonds: 20%

Cash: -5%

&amp;#x200B;

SPXTR Correlation: 0.75

SPXTR Beta: 0.49

SPX Delta/100k EUR: 13

&amp;#x200B;

The hedge has two components: 

\- ""Passive"" rolling puts

\-""Reactive"" short futures on moving average touches

&amp;#x200B;

2. Passive

Uses the convexity embedded in deep OTM puts to reduce the portfolio's SPX deltas to a net short position during a quick and violent drawdown

Allocation: \~100bps / year

Position at beginning of year:

Short 10delta Q1 ES Put

Long 2x each Q2, Q3, Q4 5delta ES Puts

https://preview.redd.it/rq98cfg0k2f81.png?width=2070&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8c6412d1e3e012e25dde7d127ec275bb0a54f50c

When the short puts expire in Q1, roll the long Q2 puts into new 5 delta 2023 Q1 puts and short new Q2 10delta puts

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The problem with this strategy by itself is that it would be relatively useless in a prolonged bear market, for example if we were to experience three -10% years in a row the puts would not get near their strike price and would be very expensive to roll on a quarterly basis.

&amp;#x200B;

3. Reactive:

This is supposed to address the problem of the above strategy. The strategy is very basic, leg into linear negative deltas at predefined points (MAs) until a desired portfolio delta is reached. For example short 20% of delta at 100MA and 30% at 200MA to reduce total delta by half. Leg out in the same way.

https://preview.redd.it/nxrl84wjn2f81.png?width=1989&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=0e21380e3ab1757ff4b08ffae38cd267e81f8c38

There are of course some obvious problems here. Firstly lots of false signals, bounces on the MA. Second, lots of wash trading on whipsaws around the MA even on correct signals. Therefore the focus here would lie on finding the optimal stop or trailing stop distances.

Do short term options' time decay happen hourly?

82,SPY: Monday Jan 31 bull vs bear channel,"interesting... just saw another channel forming on the 30 min... using the high from 1/26 and 1/28 and the lows from 1/25 and 1/28... 
now the question is will we choose the red dotted channel thats bullish or the white solid channel thats bearish. ü§îü§î. 
IF we open lower monday and do not trade higher at all pre market the white channel is definitely in play and like many of us are thinking monday will be a dip day... which gives us room to dip as low as 426 (thatd be 3.9% dip from fridays close... not impossible actually when you factor in we dipped 3.9% last monday üò¨). 
if we are trading in the red dotted channel our highs near 447.5 (1.2% higher than close) and our lows near 428 (only 3.1% from the high). 
Monday is definitely going to be a very interesting day and a very telling day. depending on which way we move and how fast/ volatile we move we can invalidate one or both of these channels real quick. im pretty confident we will be choosing one this week though. 
looking at monday though... i see the 30 min rsi is 65 and the 1 hour rsi is 64 with both MACDs ready to signal sell... id be shocked if we opened much higher monday and didnt see at least a sell off down into the mid to high 430s. a 2% dip puts us at 433. 
kinda mad i gotta work tomorrow night and will be sleeping till power hour and miss all the action. hoping to jump in around 3pm on whatever up or down trend we are on to grab some quick gains though.
at the time of writing this futures turned green from red but are not really up all that much. crypto (which honestly i believe more than anything else when it comes to market direction) is very red and has been all day continuing to sell off. based on that i am willing to bet we see a dip tomorrow.

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** was higher on the week by 1%, a move less than the 3% move options were pricing. However, it was down by roughly 3.5% on Monday and remained volatile throughout before finishing on the highs for the week.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing a nearly 2.5% move this week (about $11 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** ‚Äì Implied volatility is less than last week but still high historically. The VIX closed Friday below near 27.5. That was down slightly from last week and down significantly from the upper 30‚Äôs it saw in the early part of last week. As mentioned last week:

&gt;**Since the pandemic sell-off in early 2020, the VIX has spiked above the 30 level 5-6 times. Each time marked an end to that particular selloff/correction. However, on sustained selloffs (or crashes), implied volatility can go much higher.**

The spike in the VIX to the upper 30‚Äôs last was followed by a bounce in stocks but intra-day volatility was consistent even as the market finished slightly higher on the week. Therefore implied volatility remains elevated.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* SPY **2.5%** (about $11)
* QQQ **3.1%** (about $11)
* IWM **3.5%** (about $6)
* DIA **2.1%** (about $7)

### In the News

Bitcoin options are pricing about a 5% move into Friday. Ethereum options are pricing about a 6% move. Both of those moves are less than what was priced last week.

Hey Bull Gang, last week was brutal eh? $SPY literally moved more than 10$ every single day - I have no idea why the indices are moving like meme stocks, but the volatility is nuts. To everyone‚Äôs relief, big tech reported stellar earnings last week, and had some relatively healthy moves. I feel much safer rolling the dice on some plays this week as a result.

#The Spreadsheet
To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_uPMFTmU-7WPYpG7x0KljzMn00QVwjPpAFq__GjgtVs/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to [this link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_uPMFTmU-7WPYpG7x0KljzMn00QVwjPpAFq__GjgtVs/edit?usp=sharing) instead!

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&amp;nbsp;

- **At the time of writing, almost EVERYTHING is inefficiently priced.** Sell side reigns supreme. If you‚Äôre planning on making earnings gambles, consider selling options instead of buying them. Volatility is extremely high right now, and as result options are extremely expensive. We haven‚Äôt seen any abnormal moves come out of any companies these past three weeks, and there‚Äôs little reason for this week to be different. Instead of buying options to gamble with, sell them to the degenerate gamblers instead and collect some overinflated premiums. For each reporting company, almost every single priced move is significantly larger than the historical move. For more information on pricing inefficiencies, check out [this article.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/pricing-inefficiencies-around-earnings)

&amp;nbsp;

- **Our free money glitch has finally been patched. $SNAP is efficiently priced.** To those unaware, for the past four quarters, Snapchat options have been disgustingly cheap relative to the stocks historical move, allowing us to buy straddles and double our money consistently. MMs have finally clued in and jacked the prices up, meaning we‚Äôre sadly out of luck. Options are pricing in a move of 17%, while the historical move is around 18%. That being said, not all hope is lost. Since $SNAP reports Thursday after hours, if the market starts moving upwards and $VIX gets crushed, the combination of theta expansion and vega reduction may make these options cheap again, so be on the lookout for that - If the options end up pricing a move of less than 10%, buy straddles. If IV remains jacked up, you can look to sell the 23P for around 50$ a pop. You‚Äôll keep your money so long as $SNAP stays above 22.50, meaning your covered for a move of nearly 30%.

&amp;nbsp;

- **$PENN and $DKNG provide us with a collateral play opportunity.** Pretty straightforward play this time around - if you‚Äôre bullish or bearish on either company, you should look to enter a $DKNG position before $PENN reports earnings on Thursday. Since $PENN and $DKNG are extremely similar companies within the same sector, the $PENN report will likely move $DKNG an equivalent amount as the market prices in a similar report from the similar company. By playing $DKNG instead of $PENN, we wont get IV crushed post ER AND IV will inflate if the move goes against us, shielding some of our losses. By playing $PENN directly, we run he risk of getting IV crushed, or having a move go against us. This was just a crude summary, but I hope you all got the idea. If you wish to learn more about this type of trade, check out my writeup on collateral plays [here.](https://www.hungrybotalerts.com/blog/collateral-plays)

99,S&amp;P 500 Fair Value ATLEAST 4100 by EOY 2022," Hi all,

I would just like to validate this line of thought, because lot of bears are pointing to 20%-50% correction from current level of 4430, which I find it hard to rationalize.

**Back of the envelop calculation:** In Feb 2020, S&amp;P was at 3385. Now that we are almost out of Covid and employment and GDP is getting to pre-COVID levels, assuming COVID did not happen and applying a very **conservative** **nominal growth rate of 7%** for each year would get you approximately to these levels:

Feb 2020: 3385

Feb 2021: 3622

Feb 2022: 3875

Dec 2022: 4100

So, with S&amp;P at 4430 and Dec 2022 target of 4100, implies a base case correction of \~7.5 pct. only.

**Points in support for the argument:**

1. Fed would not raise rates so rapidly that it crashes the markets
2. Raising rates means a healthy economy, and historically markets have not crashed when Fed raised rates
3. The nominal growth rate of 7% is conservatives and does not account for higher inflation
4. Maintaining full employment, inherently implies healthy stock and bond market balance
5. Lot of USD denominated debt issued and traded, outside of US. Non-US global economies rely on UST interest rates
6. Rapid high interest rate is bad for US Treasury (think about debt servicing costs, and US Debt/GDP) and Public and Private Sector Funding.

**Points against the argument:**

1. Extremely high level of Fed Balance Sheet $9 Trn (and also a rapid rise in last 2 years). Pressure to shrink the balance sheet to Pre-Covid level before the next crisis to preserve the dollar value
2. Possibly some spill over effect of Russia/Ukraine crisis. (But I would think this would bode well for commodities)
3. Can't think of anything else... Possibly my bias..

So, I feel another 20% down from will bring S&amp;P down to \~3550 and that just seems implausible.

1,CPI Base Effect Kicks In February 2022 | Growth Stock Short Squeeze,"# Thesis 

 Inflation prints will be alot lower than 7% starting in February 2022 and kicking in March 2022 because of base effect (see table below)

||2020|2021|2022|Delta (mOm)|

|Nov|260.927||||

&amp;#x200B;

From the table, December has a massive print because of the low inflation in Dec 2021 (delta - 0.633) compared to Dec 2020 because of lockdown.  But as the US economy reopened, inflation increased (see chart), so it'll be high hurdle to bet past 7% after March 2022.  In fact, inflation will be start to roll over because of base effect in March

&amp;#x200B;

Therefore, if the correction is because of inflation fears, and inflation fears go way be March/April 2022, then we are setting up for a \*massive short squeeze\* for growth stocks.

7,Wheel Strategy Tracking Prototype App: please critique.,"I'm a developer trying to learn trading and lately more focused on the wheel strategy.


There are some resources online with great example spreadsheets to track trades and keep an eye on cost-basis/pnl, etc...


Over the weekend i put together a simple Web app to try to make the process a little bit more user friendly.


Caught in with the excitement I even bought a domain and published this early (frontend only) prototype: 

[wheelstrategy.app](https://wheelstrategy.app)

The app works entirely in the browser, you can load an example and create your own trades. The data is saved locally at the moment but i could possibly extend the project to support authentication and cloud syncing.


It's worth noting that I'm not tracking any user trades besides the regular Google analytics and there is no monetization plan at this time. However if the tool becomes more useful it could be interesting to build additional features such as a board of popular plays or other data analysis/visualization.


As mentioned, I'm still learning here so there may be some bugs in my calculations or even in the UI. My goal here is really to get some feedback on the tool and explore where this could go. Does such tool even makes sense at all?


In all cases it's for me a great learning experience so please reach out if you have any thoughts! Cheers!

18,SPY Monday January 31st Discussion,"I think friday we saw the market makers beat retail. if you play options you know MM are in control and they know all our stop losses and everything we do...
most of us who chart and watch spy a lot expected 431.7 to break and dip near 426. but it bounced and ripped harder than ive seen it do in weeks... we also broke the downward resistance line at 437 which very few expected. 
i will be interested to see what Monday brings. many say they see a dip due to a bear flag on 1 hour/ daily. many also expect favorable earnings from big tech like google and amazon to push this up near 448. 
my gut tells me we may retrace a small amount Monday but will power through this week bullish off the back of big tech beating earnings (look at apple friday). from there though if we hit the resistance at 456 i think we reject down and slide back down until the market reacts to cpi data on feb 10th. 
im looking for a good entry come monday to get some 440C to hold for the week. 
Current 30 min RSI is 65 and macd looks ready to turn to sell. lower limit of that red dotted channel is gonna be about 428-430. upper limit is around 448. 
also i want to be clear cause some were confused i think by my last post. you can be SHORT TERM bullish but still LONG TERM bearish. i think we see a small pump over the next week or 2. BUT until we break the resistance line from 1/3 and 1/13 which puts resistance near 456... we are STILL in a downward bear trend. if we break 456 in the next couple weeks i will consider a bull case to retake 480 until then we are still bearish.

29,Help on VIX options,"Hello everyone, I am fairly new to this and needed to some help in understanding which is the better option to buy 

So let‚Äôs say I believe that that stock market will crash sometime this year. And with a crash the VIX will spike like it did during the March 2020 crash. 

Let‚Äôs say hypothetically that the ViX goes up to 40. In that case which of this two are the better option to buy: 

April 2022 28c 
Oct 2022 28c 

Both look to have similar profitability if the vix spikes. 

Wouldn‚Äôt it be a no brainer to buy the Oct calls rather than the April calls, just to be on the safer side and giving enough time for the VIX to possibly spike.

Right now, I have a slew of short puts in IWM, many are currently underwater and ITM. Despite this, my daily theta from the positions hovers around $1800 and $2300. Each day, some amount of theta is bleeding out of the options. I will simply adjust the positions as needed come expiration. I will either roll the positions or take assignment and begin the covered strangle.

52,Trade idea: using low Delta SPY covered puts for income vs. bond ETF,"Sorry for the longer post but I'm looking for wisdom. I'm pretty new to options overall but I've done a decent amount of reading and understand the risks of what I'm getting into with the strategy below. Obviously a lot more experience here so I'd like some feedback on what I'm thinking about,

I have mid six figure amount sitting in a bond ETF in a taxable account. I'll be selling this soon to capture some capital losses and was thinking about how I'd like to redeploy the money. Normally I'd shuffle this to another bond ETF, wait 30 days and then move it back to avoid wash sale rules. This time I'm thinking about selling covered puts on SPY.

Here are my criteria for this proposed trade sequence:

1. Trade only SPY options
2. Generate as much income as possible with the lowest risk of being assigned possible (who doesnt want this &lt;g&gt;)
3. Do this by selling cash covered puts on the MWF daily expirations at either the -.15 or lower delta strikes or a strike price equivalent to current strike prirce minus 5%
4. If the trade looks like I'll be assigned, I'll either take the loss by closing the position and buying the puts back (or selling covered calls post assignment til it closes)
5. I plan on closing trades out and giving back a small amount of premium to ensure a ""winning"" trade on the ones that work out
6. Stop the trades once I hit more than 30K in losses (I know this seems like an arbitrary amount but it is the amount of the loss I'm getting ready to harvest next week. I'm ok with the same loss coming from this idea if it could yield more income)

To start, I am 100% ok with owning SPY if I get assigned and realize that is a risk. I'd just prefer to keep that from happening which is why I'm looking at these lower probability strike prices. The -.15 delta would be the riskiest trade I'd go with this but I'm mostly considering the 5% off trading price at noon. I've back tested this via TOS and it seems like a high percentage of these trades worked out. I would have hit some issues in March 2020 but even then, there were only a couple days where this ended up in assignment.

As a sample of this IRL...the paper trades I did yesterday, would have had me either selling the -.15 delta puts at 422 strike for a $.96 premium or the 5% from current price at 414 strike for $.24 premium. I'll be selling \~17 contracts at a time. So -.15 delta gave me a $1,632 premium and 5% gave me a $408 premium. If I were able to replicate the 5% trade 3x/wk then that would be \~1200/wk in premiums with a very low chance of assignment. My bond ETF currently pays out a $1,200 dividend/mo on this same amount of capital so that would be a 400% increase in income with an unrealistic 100% win rate. If I could capture \~75% of this per month, I'd be happy. Is that realistic?

So, what am I missing here? Is this a super dumb idea? Given this was going to sit in bonds anyways earning a low rate, this seems like a good idea to me but I'm sure I'm missing something.",options,1643491286

The criminals that took GME down 371 points (77%) with only 8 million shares should rot in jail

Who was pulling the strings on multiple brokers to ban clients from buying $GME and causing panic selling as well as margin liquidations? By locking out investors, brokers took away the bid for the stock. The market makers then orchestrated a drop of 371 points, 77% with ONLY 8 million shares traded triggering multiple trading halts. It was brutal, especially, when GME only moved 10-20 points on similar volume on previous trading days. A full comprehensive investigation is necessary. Also investigators must take a close look at what happened to the options during that time. These criminals should rot in jail.

Edit: This video shows how they brought $GME down 371 points (77%) and also how they brought down the $GME options. It‚Äôs a must see. https://youtu.be/YKNIf2PHvf4",options,1643476691

So those of you who tuned in for the intraday discussion today (which was a lot of fun doing that together and seeing everyone talk) those wont be happening as much now. I hope to do them one or two days a week still though. I also will still try to update daily like i have been. Just some times posts may not happen to very late into the night. 

Well SPY like always wants to be the wild child of the stock market. However, even in her wildness she gives us signs and hints of where its going (thankfully). 

Historically January tends to be a bearish month, however, unless you live under a rock for the last few weeks you would see we had A LOT more than usual. From increasingly out of control inflation, ole Putin stepping out and then of course daddy powell. Big oof this month, however, as people like to say never bet against the stock market. So heres what im seeing and where we are going. 

Today we saw yet again a volatile day. I think i can speak for many of us that we expected the typical dip, run and then dip at the end of the day. Its friday after all... but spy lovessss to switch it up. That resistance line (the green dotted) was so u believably strong it had been tested and rejected 6 times. But one ole Biden started speaking he whispered sweet nothings to the market and boom boom we broke the major resistance trend.

Ironically our sibling NASDAQ saw their similar downward channel break too.

https://i.imgur.com/hr0Y5ol.jpeg

On NASDAQ we got the MACD curling up to sell and the RSI trending upward. 
https://i.imgur.com/StW61cG.jpeg

On spy we have a very similiar setup occuring too. https://i.imgur.com/PPJ4oCn.jpeg

Heres what im seeing and where we may be headed and how im playing the month of February.

So nasdaq. Im seeing a clear break of the bear channel (blue dotted). But im seeing another clearly formed bullish channel (white dotted). Im seeing a resistance line near 14.1k (using previous high from 1/4 and 1/13 a perfect intersection happens at 14.1k at the top resistance line of the white dotted channel. Im also seeing the daily 20 ema intersecting around this area too. Will definitely be keeping an eye on this. 

Now with spy. We are looking at the red dotted bullish channel. Im watching a similiar trend line from 1/4 and 1/13 which intersects the top resistance line of the red dotted channel near 456. 

I note that SPYs channel is more aggressive than the NASDAQ channel. However both are on very similar trajectories here. 

Now one thing i will be watching is that even im this new bullish channel for spy is that we have a lot of downside still. The 30 min and 1 hour are still pretty overbought (not extremely but slightly). There is still a chance we see a major sell off sometime next week perhaps even monday. Currently support will be somewhere by time pre market moves and everything around 428-430. After such an impressive end of day run today it would be natural to expect some to be given back monday. 

Heres how im playing the next few weeks... (keep in mind im going back to work full time night shift so i also wont be able to day trade as much as i could the last 2 weeks).

Im going to be watching the charts next week come monday and be looking for a small dip to go long on some calls here. I will be doing my normal style: first otm strike for whenever i finally buy in but im going to do a 14 dte. Will plan to hold for some nice profit and then roll it out depending on gains and everything provable every 7 days. 

Im going to be watching for the upper resistance line test near 448-450 short term next week and long term of 456 by 2nd week of February. 

I still hope to do some intraday trading but because of work im gonna be doing mostly longs holding and rolling profits unless i see a change of direction.

One thing everyone needs to watch out for is Feb 10th inflation data releasing. No more fed meetings till March so really from here we got some room to run free till the fed drops the hammer again.",options,1643421889

From what I've gathered, you'd take out a margin loan with your broker, buy the securities you want, then sell a box spread for the amount to cover that margin loan and pay it back right away. So now your loan is from the box spread which is not callable and thus you are safe from a margin call? I have also read that this only really works with Portfolio margin, which unfortunately does not exist in Canada. I believe what we have here is essentially reg T with some securities having the exception of only requiring 30% for margin requirement. Is using SPX box spreads still feasible if this is the case?

For the most part I‚Äôm a long term equity dividend investor, and I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm mostly just interested in the income strategy of selling OTM calls on stocks I own in order to accelerate purchasing stocks and building passive income. I already understand what calls and puts are, so I believe these questions are more mechanical in nature and might in some cases be specific to the brokerage I‚Äôm using, E*Trade.  I might wind up using some incorrect terminology, so bear with me:

1. Is the premium received at the time the option is sold, or at the time the contract expires?

2. If the contract goes ITM can it be executed at any point in the time frame, or does execution only occur at the end time of the contract?

3. If the contract is executed, do I need to do anything?  Does the sale just occur automatically?  When setting up the option, do I need to do anything special to specify that my shares are covering the call?

4. How is the premium treated for tax purposes?  Capital gains, or income, or some other way entirely?

Anyway, this is a good start, and I hope it fosters more questions.",options,1643411881

5,AMD/XLNX,"I was looking at the option pricing for both before earnings on Feb 1.  I noticed that the IV for AMD is quite a bit higher than that of XLNX.  Share price has been holding around 1.69/1 with the announcement that there is preliminary approval from the Chinese gov.  Assuming share price ratio holds, isnt there a play here on the pricing?  I have the AMD shares now.  I picked the first total premiums that were relatively close.

Sell 12 CC AMD - $6,096 premium collected

Buy 9 Call XLNX - $6,021 premium paid

True ratio if I buy 12 AMD contracts would be just over 7.  I get better leverage for free from what I can tell.  

If the price moves down, I lose nothing as I plan to hold my shares either way

If the price moves up, I have higher leverage and should theoretically profit more.  7 contracts (710 shares) are roughly break even so its all profit on the 2 contract.  Am I missing something here?",options,1643407539

7,"Robinhood identified this trade as ""High Risk"" and closed it automatically on my behalf, costing me $175.

Right after 3pm Robinhood sold my position for $3 because they identified this position as ""high-risk"" and automatically closed it out. AAL was trading at about $15.40 and going up steadily. The market finished way up and AAL closed at $15.64 and if you see the chart below, it just doesn't make sense.

35 contracts x $7/call = $245. RH sold @ $3 for $105 (loss of $145). I understand that once ALL was in the money that RH would sell the option, but by then it would be worth a lot more than $3.

Hey everyone. I‚Äôm running PMCCs and was wondering if you guys look at probability of profit at all when selling calls? For February 4th AAL has 16c for 75% POP, 16.5c has 81% POP, 17c has 87% POP (AAL is currently 15.46). Now, obviously the higher up you go the better your chances for expiring OTM, hence less and less credit you‚Äôd receive. My overall breakeven is 18.05, so part of me wants to just sell calls at 18 and I don‚Äôt even have to worry about rolling up and out if I wanted to let it go (I wouldn‚Äôt for extrinsic value). $18 is only worth $4, so I don‚Äôt see a point. at the same time something like $17c for $18 credit doesn‚Äôt seem bad and a fairly decent POP, but AAL could easily move a dollar in a day so definitely isn‚Äôt everything.

36,Options with Training Wheels aka Defined Outcome Investing,"When people want to dip their toes into options, so often they start with buying single leg options because it seems simpler to grasp. But what they don't realize is that they're playing a losing game and when the market moves against them, the results can be disastrous. Counter-intuitively, more complicated option strategies are actually safer and provide higher probability of winning. When you create spreads with options, you can achieve what we call ""defined outcome investing.""

Institutional investors and the top 1% have been using defined outcome investing products for decades (in the form of structured notes and annuities and more recently unit investment trusts and exchange-traded funds). Retail investors should have access to the same tools to achieve less risk and a defined return on their investments in the market. 

## How Does Defined Outcome Investing Work?¬†

First, let‚Äôs define some terms that are relevant to defined outcome investing:¬†

**Reference asset -** Each defined outcome investment is linked to the performance of a reference stock, ETF, or index. 

**Reference price -** This is the price of the reference stock, ETF, or market index.

**Outcome period -** A defined outcome investment is not infinite. It is an option contract with a set time period.  

**Cushion -** The cushion is the amount of the underlying asset price can go down before you lose any of your investment. In other words, this is the amount of safety blanket you have for your investment against the market.

*Example:* If the market index **reference asset** falls by 18%, but your defined outcome investment has a buffer of 15%, then you will only lose 3% overall. The cushion has absorbed most of the decline. Some popular buffers are set to 9%, 15%, or 30%.

**Ceiling -** The ceiling is a cap on the maximum amount of profit you can receive as the underlying reference asset price goes up. You are cap your upside in exchange for the buffer.

*Example:* Say that the reference asset price soars by 35% but your upside cap is 30%. You would collect up to the first 30% of the reference asset‚Äôs increase, and miss out on 5% of the gain.  


When you combine these concepts into a defined outcome investment strategy, you can create security for your investment, even during market volatility. The contract of the defined outcome investment is set for the outcome period. You can withdraw early if the value reaches your target profit earlier. 

## What Are the Benefits?

* **Customizable risk-return profiles**  
With defined outcome investing, you can personalize your risk-return profile to align with your long-term strategy. You can be conservative or aggressive.¬†Your buffer can be set to absorb downside volatility while keeping your cap high enough to help you reach your financial goals. Or if you're particularly bullish on an asset you can accelerate the upside in exchange for a ceiling on the profit.  

* **Income Generation**  
You can define certain outcomes to provide a fixed return that is superior to bonds and CDs while taking a reasonable level of risk. 

## What kind of Outcomes Can be Achieved?

There are three main objectives that can be achieved with defined outcome investing:¬†  


1. **Income / Preservation**  
*Best for investors who want to preserve capital, even in a down market.*   
The preservation strategy offers maximum cushion and a fixed return. The drawback to this strategy is that the ceiling is typically lower than with other strategies. Put spreads are commonly used for this objective.   
‚Äç  
*Example*:   
Buy 1 $120 put  
Buy 3 $125 puts  
 Sell 5 $135 puts    
1/20/23 expiration   
Nets a fixed **13%** **(13%** **annualized)** unless $AAPL falls below **18%** (**$133.97**) as of 01/20/2023

1. **Growth**  
*Best for bullish investors who want to collect profits earlier*  
The growth strategy is on the opposite end of the spectrum in terms of risk. There is typically no downside protection, but in exchange for the ceiling you get accelerated profit.   
*Example*:    
Buy 2 $160 calls   
Sell 2 $170 calls   
Sell 1 $170 put    
9/16/22 expiration   
Accelerates gains by **3.2x** and makes up to **20.8% (34.7% annualized)** on $AAPL through 9/16/2022.

1. **Hedged / Buffered**  
*Best for medium risk, medium reward long term investors*   
This is the meeting of the two above strategies and is the most popular for defined outcome investing. You set a ceiling and a cushion that keeps your investment within parameters that match your objectives and outlook on that asset.  
*Example*:   
Buy 1 $160 call  
Sell 1 $185 call  
Sell 1 $140 put  
11/18/22 expiration  
Makes up to **18.3% (23.1% annualized)** unless $AAPL falls below **13%** (**$143.19**) as of 11/18/2022

46,"With the expansion of selling pressure on US stocks and the surge of bearish sentiment, which hedging tools may avoid risks?","Since this year, under the background of high inflation, investors' concerns about the upcoming hawkish monetary policy of the Federal Reserve have put pressure on the stock market.

Last night, the Federal Reserve finally had a ""Showdown"". In the face of Powell's ""Hawkish"" policy signal, US stocks staged a 1000 point dive.

The DOW, which rose more than 500 points in the morning, plunged rapidly, with a daily decline of more than 400 points and an amplitude of nearly 1000 points. The largest decline in the S &amp; P and Nasdaq was more than 1%. So far, the S &amp; P 500, the NASDAQ and the Dow have fallen back to their levels six months ago.

**Bearish sentiment in US stocks rose sharply**

According to the CBOE put / call stock option trading volume ratio, bearish sentiment in US stocks has soared recently.

As of January 21, the trading volume ratio of CBOE put / call stock options was as high as 0.82, which was at the high point of 6% in the past 25 years. This shows that investors are currently in a more pessimistic state, and their bearish sentiment on the stock market is at a relatively high level.

Historically, the ratio has soared whenever U.S. stocks plummeted.

The higher the ratio reading, the higher the proportion of put options in US stocks, and then the stronger the bearish sentiment in the market.

Under the panic, the ""bottom reading strategy"" failed, and investors turned back to short

Recently, the overall market selling pressure has expanded, and many investors may be looking for ways to protect their portfolios. Among them, short ETF has once again become the best choice for most investors.

Data show that the ""bargain hunting"" strategy has failed periodically recently. Individual investors in US stocks have begun to change their strategies and are buying short the Nasdaq 100 Index ETF on a large scale - the fund mainly bet on the decline of the Nasdaq 100 index to profit from the decline of the stock market.

According to the data compiled by JPMorgan strategists, individual investors bought $76.6 million during the stock market crash on Monday, and the NASDAQ triple short ETF (SQQQ. US) $. The performance of this ETF is three times that of the Nasdaq 100 index in the opposite direction. It is one of the most distinctive trading varieties in the U.S. stock market, allowing investors to avoid opening new options The futures account can carry out portfolio hedging to avoid risks and win profit opportunities in the bear market.

According to Vanda research, in the past five trading days, individual investors bought about $121 million on SQQQ, the highest level in nearly five years. Since this year, SQQQ has increased by nearly 50%.

However, it is worth noting that if the market rebounds, ETF holders may face large losses.

The market falls endlessly, and the reverse leverage ETF may avoid risks

Reverse leverage ETF takes advantage of the negative emotions of Wall Street investors, which can be used to reflect investors' bearish sentiment, and also allow investors to hedge their portfolios at a lower cost to avoid systemic risks.

However, it should be noted that this kind of ETF is not suitable for long-term investment. It can only be used for short-term hedging or speculative purposes, and the expense ratio of this kind of professional fund is generally high, which may affect the total return.",options,1643358765

For February 4th AAL has 17c for $18- 83% POP, and 17.5c for $11- 88% POP. Now, obviously the higher up you go the better your chances for expiring OTM, hence less and less credit you‚Äôd receive. My overall breakeven is 18.05, so part of me wants to just sell calls at 18 and I don‚Äôt even have to worry about rolling up and out if I wanted to let it go (I wouldn‚Äôt for extrinsic value). $18 is only worth $6, so I don‚Äôt see a point. at the same time something like $17c for $18 credit doesn‚Äôt seem bad and a fairly decent POP, but AAL could easily move that dollar in a day so definitely isn‚Äôt everything.

Also make sure to follow my actual profile on here because all these subs LOVEEEE deleting my ta for whatever reason... 

Anyways lets get into it! 

To me today was a confirmation day. I fully expected after market and futures wise that we woulda started the day down 1-2% not up 1.5% i believe it was. Nonetheless today was a very telling day in my opinion. What we saw today was a retest of the upper limit of this downward bearish channel we have been trading in since January 3rd. Look at the green dotted channel on the 30 minute. It has developed some very strong resistance now with from January 3rd to present being touched and officially rejected 4 times and 2 other times where it nearly touched the line. Thats a very stout resistance line that if we ever break it should provide some very heavy upward movement. https://i.imgur.com/bBk4yhZ.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/8iDmj1m.jpeg

What i watched develop this morning intraday (always watching the 30 min) was the MACD turning from buy to sell AND most importantly as we neared the top of the channel at the time of 441.5 was that the RSI was around 63. To me that showed that this did not have the momentum to break through. When we rejected the 441.5 twice i bought some 2/4 440P and 339p and one 1/28 440p... all three played very heavily. I got greedy and missed some gains though when we broke 430 for a second but recovered to 433 before market close. I was looking for the bottom drop and never got it. Left some on the table but still paid out &gt;50% for all 3.  Not bad at all. 

Things im watching for tomorrow is Apple crushing earnings and being up 5% after hours. Now apple can NOT hold the market up on its own as much as people like to think it can. However oddly enough once apple released cry*pto pulled outta its nose dive and spy went from red to green. However, take tesla for instance today... tesla was down 5% while spy was up nearly 2% and tesla finished down 11%. Even the otherday on Tuesday Microsoft was up while the market was down if i remember correctly (or inverse). Either way what im saying is one company will not hold the market up. Though apple is the first big top 10 to release a stellar earnings so some sentiment may change... just keep in mind after and pre market are easily skewed by retail... tesla today was up right until the market open then we saw the true hedgefund take... 
(side note i bet tesla starts its decline down to 500-600 now... tesla today once again broke 25% correction from highs... the market FINALLY sees tesla as over valued and i think we see them take a fairly big hit down. Once this does it will finish our correction of spy and nasdaq to total of 25%... i think msft and apple will maintain their valuations). 

So onto tomorrow what should we suspect? 

Well interestingly after hours on my chart (some webull users say they did not see this on theirs). I saw a massive spike up to again fall just short of the green dotted resistance line. 

30 min macd did turn to buy. Rsi is curling upward and leaving room for another run at this resistance line. Though i doubt we break it. My anticipation is tomorrow we test that resistance line early morning again near 439-440 and then dip after again. 

We saw extremely strong support today near 430. We DID break it very quickly but the buy pressure was too much. This is our fight zone. 430 and 440. One thing i am seeing is we have moved so far upward in this green dotted channel that unless we see some massive sell off days despite being bearish long term we will break it. However 2 or 3 days of nothing but sell offs (which we have not seen any days of just pure red this week will push us low enough to stay in the channel). Realistically we need a red day to finish down 1-2% in order to stay in this channel. And honestly we are kinda due for one. Im shocked that both today and yesterday stopped short of only about 0.5-1% down.

Supports intraday- 429.5 --&gt; 425 --&gt; 420.76 
Resistance intraday- 434.5 --&gt; 440 --&gt; breakout

Support-
-1%=427
-2%= 422.6
-3%= 418.3 

Resistance-
+1%=435.6
+2%= 439.8
+3% 444.17

Looking at the % up and down we can go its interesting that being up 2% tomorrow still keeps us in this bearish channel. Now mind you as time progresses the channel progresses with the chart so towards end of day tomorrow the upper limit of the channel will probably be closer to 438 or so...  i really am surprised we have not sold off yet to touch that 420 support area we saw this week... and i think maybe tomorrow could be the day it happens. 

Overall the chart and sentiment is still bearish. If and when we break this green dotted channel i will consider whether or not we are bullish. There is another resistance line up near 460 we have to break in order to see a full recovery breakout.",options,1643333191

58,Buying puts = owning the shares after executing?,"Quick question on buying puts, I have a Zillow put at a $40 strike price expires 1/22/22. This is the only one I have bought but I do plan to buy more, just bought that one to get my feet wet and start understanding the mechanics. From what I understand, when I bought these puts it gives me a right to buy 100 shares at or below the strike price, when I execute the contract does this automatically sell the stock at the price I bought the contract in and adds the money to my balance? Or does this come in shares since I‚Äôm ‚Äúbuying‚Äù the puts?

Also, with robinhoods interface (also on fidelity but a lot less user friendly) it gives me the option when looking at my contract to ‚Äúbuy‚Äù ‚Äúsell‚Äù (maybe a stupid question) but this is talking about the stock itself correct? I don‚Äôt understand why these are options when I have an ‚Äúexecute‚Äù option. From my understanding when I do want to execute my contract I would simply hit ‚Äúexecute‚Äù correct?

71,My first major disaster as an options trader,"Around October-December 2021, I made the stupid decision to put the majority of my buying power into SPY PMCCs. Stocks only go up, right? This is what I was doing:

* Buying deep ITM calls, 45 DTE, 80 delta
* Selling weekly OTM calls (aka poor man covered calls), 40 delta

Every day, I was adjusting my positions by rolling them up or down the long legs or short legs to reset them back to 80 and 40. This was working... for a while. Until the market took a giant dump and recently it got worse and seems like with the current situation with the inflation and interest rate hikes, we are entering a bear market and stonks won't go up any time soon.

Now, my portfolio is down more than 60%. I don't have any more buying power to buy the dip more. I'm also not selling any covered calls until the market rallies to the resistance, because I'm holding my long legs to save my portfolio. I have around 36 days to expiry.

I'm really frustrated with this situation and my portfolio bleeding. I think I'm hitting the [valley of despair](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_Effect_01.svg). I could have hedged things more and not put my eggs in one basket and avoided the overly leveraged short term PMCC spreads. Perhaps LEAPS would have been a better idea, but what's done is done. I'm fucked :)

I desire a hard reset, but at the same time, I'm hoping my portfolio will recover. Hate this directionality of my portfolio. I want to go back to a delta neutral portfolio and start selling iron condors and naked puts at support levels.

TLDR: I fucked up by opening lots of overly leveraged SPY short term spreads and now I'm paying the price for it now.",options,1643311609

83,Book/site for hedging loss making leg in a short strangle (deep OTM) in Indian markets?,"Hi,
I've been selling short deep OTM strangles for a while now on the indian stock market, with a 2-3% return on capital pm where I use around 30%-50% of the margin and leave the rest for changing legs of the positions or adding legs mid expiry and such.
So usually I keep the price at around +15% from the Current market price and when price starts to move closer, i change the legs, and go deeper. 7/10 times this works, but that 1-2 odd months just eat away most of the profit i earned over the period because the movements are fast and very unexpected. At those times, i just get perplexed as to whether i should wait, theta do its work, wait for the iv crush or just hope for the best.. i think of hedging it with longs but they'd just eat away the premiums on both sides( also since movements are strong, iv is higher and long puts become expensive).

So, what I'm looking for is when there is one directional movement, and changing/rolling the strike price won't help, how do i hedge the loss making leg? 
For example, $100 price today. I sell 90$ put and 110$ call.. now the price starts to move beyond let's say 105, starts creeping up closer to 110$. Now i want to make sure the loss is mitigated/handled. I don't want the trade to end up in huge losses. A risk reward of 1:1 or 1:1.5 is okay,i think. 
I know buying longs can help.. but timing those, and buying them at the right price is a challenge. 
Question is how do i hedge these positions? Its not often that the deep otm strike prices get struck, but when it does, it takes away a good chunk of the profits earned over the period..

Tl;dr- need advice/guidance on ways to hedge my short deep OTM strangles..any book, any website, or you could add your 2 cents here, that would be immensely helpful.",options,1643303675

I‚Äôm curious about the assignment risks of debit spreads(call and put) on SPY vs SPX. I understand the dividend&gt;extrinsic value of short leg will pose assignment risks. 


1. Does it affect for both debit put and debit call spreads? 
2. If option expiration is Mar 11th and next Ex div date is Mar 18th, am I under huge risk?
3. Is the early assignment only going to happen if dividend value &gt; extrinsic short leg value , regardless of how far between expiration &amp; ex div?
4. In this case, despite bigger spreads, SPX is far more superior to play spreads given the absence of early assignment risk?

11,Is the market crash ended? Just the beginning! The market crash is every 7 years," 

n the few week before, i was post my article about US market crash every 7 years, so 2022 will market crash. But only few people accept this article's viewpoint, Now Nasdaq and Dow has intraday reversad, so the crash is ended?

Huge reversal days are rare Ôºå there are only six historical precedents for the Nasdaq dropping 4% or more and closing higher ‚Äî in data spanning about 34 years.

The Other days are:

10/28/97

10/26/00

7/15/02

10/10/08

11/13/08

and this time 1/24/2022

If we expand the simple size from 1929, there are the average loss after the reversal date was 13.36% with a median of 6.72%

As I mentioned before, The economic cycle of U.S. stocks has a very obvious 7-year cycle.

\-In 1966, the United States experienced a ""credit crunch"". In August of the same year, the U.S. Treasury market suffered a severe ""liquidity crisis.

\-In 1973, seven years later, the world suffered the ""first oil crisis"", with stock market and economic problems and the first stagflation.

\-Seven years later, in 1980, Wall Street forced the Hunt brothers to stop hoarding silver , which helped some banks and securities firms to avoid bankruptcy.

\-In October 1987, the Dow fell 22% in one day on ""Black Monday"".

\-Seven years later, in 1994, the FED raised interest rates six times in a row, and interest rates rose sharply from 3% to 6%, resulting in the most famous bond massacre in history.

\-Seven years later, in 2001, the Black Swan event of 9/11 triggered a severe setback in the global stock market, and the U.S. declared an emergency stock market closure from 9/11 to 9/14, but the market resumed on the 17th, the U.S. stocks still had a panic sale, the S&amp;P 500 index opened at 1,092 points and closed almost at the low of 1,038 points, down 5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index was killed to 8,883 points, down 7%, and the stock market fell 14% in one week.

The 7-year cycle came to 2008, the financial tsunami, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks plunged.

\-In 2015, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks crash.

\-2022:?

I would predict that in 2022, there may be a significant pullback in US stocks.

Stop asking why there is no 2020/3, because there is more than one starting point for the cycle and there are different periods that affect the stock market, and 2022 is a 7 year cycle",options,1643249115

14,SPY and nasdaq long term outlook,"If you went into todays fomc saying you were confident that Jpow was gonna play the same tune as he has for the last 2 years you are naive... a couple of takes from todays FOMC that i think is what made the market really negatively react. 

The market was not happy that they didnt do more with interest rates. The market (when i say market i mean analysts too) were not happy that with what many described as a under reaction to inflation and too laid back of an approach. Markets and analysts wanted some clear cut gjidance on EXACTLY what fed was gonna do to fight inflation and make the stock market continue its bull run. It did not deliver that. i have not listened live to many of jpows talks but he seemed nervous and seemed like he himself wasnt sure what he was gonna do to fix this or when and the markets didnt like that.
JPOW also numerous times to different people reiterated that the fed was NOT going to continue the same monetary policy as the past. Everytime he said that live the market literally dropped ü§£. 
The other thing i wanna touch on before moving forward was his take on inflation. He stated in many different ways and numerous times that inflation was much WORSE than anticipated. However he tried to ensure the market just as much that they believed they would see it over by end of year. 
Something id like other people's take on is what he was referring to about saying the labor market was near max. It sounded like to me he clearly stated that there were plenty of openings and more openings than unemployed but the labor market was at its max. Anyone got clarification there? 

What were your take on the meeting? 

(Skip to the end if you want nasdaq TA)

Okay to the market TA. 
Today my suspicion all day was the market was pricing in good news for jpow and was expecting excellent news and pumped itself to that level accordingly. Only to dip (notably not as bad as i thought) after the real reaction was seen. 

Some things im keeping at eye on is the bearish channel we have formed and are trading within since January 3rd. 
https://i.imgur.com/kolsfRd.jpeg

Todays initial positive reaction took us to the resistance line of the channel near 444. This was a key rejection in my opinion as it was not only a rejection at the 30 min 200 EMA, but it was also now our third rejection at this bearish channels upper resistance line. Thats a big deal in my opinion and is solidifying the bearish channel and further downside. 
https://i.imgur.com/e5lZ1Bf.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/DbXvpt4.jpeg

So where are we headed next? 

I think today we saw a clear rejection of a potential bullish breakout, we saw the fed is NOT gonna prop the market up and that we are going to see some bear market times ahead.

In my experience its not the day of good or bad news but the NEXT day where we truly see the reaction. Currently we are about to close after-hours and SPY/ futures are barely green. Though i dont suspect to see much movement till pre market. (As i wrote this we just sold off to finish red after market). 

Tomorrow and into next week my anticipation is we will see yet another sell off with a final resting place near 408 before we see any upside. 

Intraday supports/ resistance for tomorrow:
S- 428.7 --&gt; 420.76 (previous low) --&gt; 408 (bottom of lower dotted channel). 
S- -1%= 429.04 --&gt; -2%= 424.7 --&gt; -3%= 420.4 --&gt;-4%= 416.1

R- 435.1 --&gt; 438.5 --&gt; 444 (upper limit of dotted channel)
R- +1%= 437.7 --&gt; +2%= 442.1 --&gt; +3%= 446.4 --&gt; +4%= 450.7

Looking at the supports and resistance lines for tomorrow i like us finishings around that 420 tomorrow for a retest of support there. 

Long term for SPY if we look way back to 2018/2019 and their ""bull run"" and project that forward to current day we could see our final resting place near 360. For me this is my mental price target for the ""bottom"". I will look to start buying some longer 3-6 months DTEs around this area... this would give us a total correction of exactly 25% from highs if we hit 360. 
https://i.imgur.com/2SUKox1.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/WDYwesp.jpeg

Now nasdaq i have just as bearish outlook for this. To me i see a similiar projection using 2019 ""bull run"" that puts this near a low of 12.3k. Nasdaq is also trading in a very clear downward channel too (blue dotted lines). 12.3k gives nasdaq a correction of 25% also. I Truly believe this is where we are headed next.

* I've completed scaling in to my max allocation ($15K total, 35 lot at an agg basis of $4.27)
* I maintain my longer-term bullish disposition and continue to structure the trade to maintain upside potential
* This trade falls into my speculative allocation and I'm okay losing the entire investment (although I'd prefer to make money). This is an important note, because I'd handle this trade far different if it were in my core allocation (although this product won't be in my core allocation any time soon).

Current trade R:R Profile, notice how there is no upside risk in the trade. 

https://preview.redd.it/d3myz0xgm4e81.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aea76ec6099e684e41319a7b91107be2eb3f44a4

Today (26Jan) I added (20) 18Mar 9C @ 0.33 for a total of $660 or 4.4% ROIC. I'm using these premiums to continue realizing gain (thus reducing my unrealized net loss) while ensuring the trade has plenty of room to run if it catches a bid.

Again, this is one of the neat part of options. We have flexibility to improve our position even when things don't go our way - in my case, I've enjoyed a -48% decline (See chart below, I entered on 2Dec - the highlighted candle when HUT was \~$11). Even in this trade, despite being completely wrong directionally, I've been able to realize a profit while the LEAPS are at an unrealized loss. Additionally, even if the trade doesn't go my way, I'll be able to reduce the impact to the invested principal.

Again, this is a highly speculative trade (closely tied to bitcoin). Throwing good money after bad is generally a losing prospect. I'm playing with fire however, again, this is a speculative trade - I'm okay with the risk.

20,Inflation crashes the market but the Fed trying to avoid inflation also crashes the market?,"Maybe I don't have this straight but in any case this is my understanding.

Whenever we hear the econo-punditry saying that inflation is coming or currently happening (prices have skyrocketed!) the Market takes a hit.

Then, when the Fed responds to this by trying to stave off the inflation by raising rates, that also causes the Market to take a hit.

I think the general rationale is that if inflation is creeping into the economy then the expectation in the market is that the fed will raise rates.

But...by that logic, you should be selling out of the market when the Fed is printing money and hang onto your cash and then buy back in when the inflation/inflation-fixing starts happening.

**Successfully Predicted US Stock Crash! Using Astrological Perspectives to See the U.S. Turning the Dollar or Financial Change by Pluto Return in 2022**

In our previous article, we mentioned that US stocks have fallen every seven years and as a result my fans should have made a lot of money. I promised to post an article on the analysis by financial astrology. We find that the US will begin the return of Pluto and that the time after that may see an important financial and trade related change in the US.

In astrology, the cycle of Saturn is 30 years, and if a person turns 30, it means that Saturn has returned to the same house as your birth, which is called a Saturn Return. Pluto has a cycle of 248 years, but while it is clear that an individual will not live long enough to experience a Pluto return, the United States is close to welcoming one, and a major financial change is likely to be expected.

The United States is 242 years past its Declaration of Independence in 1776. Pluto's cycle is 248 years, and because it travels slowly, the effects have already begun. Pluto is a malefic planet, symbolising destruction, rebirth, desire, death, extremism, unconsciousness, etc.

Pluto's Return in the UK

We can perhaps look at Pluto's return in the United States in the light of the UK's return, which has seen a total of three Pluto returns. Using the date of William the Conqueror's coronation, 25 December 1066, as the birthday of modern England, the first return occurred around 1311 to 1315; the second around 1555-1562; and the last around 1801-1810.

England's first return: The 'Great Famine', which began in 1315, led to great social unrest and the death of millions of people in the following years.

Britain's Second Pluto Return: A major rebellion in Kent in 1554 and the mass persecution of the Puritans in 1555, as well as the accession of Queen Mary I as the first female monarch to rule alone in England.

England's third return to Pluto: This took place between 1801 and 1810 and marked the formal formation of the United Kingdom, the union of Great Britain (England, Wales and Scotland) with Ireland. Britain also saw many wars: the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, the Napoleonic Wars of 1803 to 1815, the Peninsular War of 1808 to 1814, the Anglo-Russian War of 1807 to 1812, the Anglo-Swiss War of 1810 and the Anglo-American War of 1812.

Pluto's return to the United States

The United States will experience its first Pluto return in 2022

Pluto will be influencing the second house (domestic trade, economic conditions, money markets, banking and financial institutions, national wealth) and the eighth house (customs and taxation, insurance and finance, international finance, transnational corporations) for some time to come. This is a forced redefinition of the above areas. This means that the entire global financial system and economic reform will undergo a major overhaul in the coming years.

The year 2024 is the year of Pluto's transit, when Pluto will move from Capricorn into Aquarius. Pluto has been in Capricorn since the beginning of 2008 and has been travelling through Capricorn for more than 16 years. That was the world of QE quantitative easing in the decade after the financial tsunami. But this will move into Aquarius in 2024. It may represent an important turning point in economic development. So the US will also have US difficulties and perhaps the US will change and influence the dollar or finance.

And it is believed that a new financial model, currency etc. will emerge around 2025

As I mentioned before, The economic cycle of U.S. stocks has a very obvious 7-year cycle.

\-In 1966, the United States experienced a ""credit crunch"". In August of the same year, the U.S. Treasury market suffered a severe ""liquidity crisis.

\-In 1973, seven years later, the world suffered the ""first oil crisis"", with stock market and economic problems and the first stagflation.

\-Seven years later, in 1980, Wall Street forced the Hunt brothers to stop hoarding silver , which helped some banks and securities firms to avoid bankruptcy.

\-In October 1987, the Dow fell 22% in one day on ""Black Monday"".

\-Seven years later, in 1994, the FED raised interest rates six times in a row, and interest rates rose sharply from 3% to 6%, resulting in the most famous bond massacre in history.

\-Seven years later, in 2001, the Black Swan event of 9/11 triggered a severe setback in the global stock market, and the U.S. declared an emergency stock market closure from 9/11 to 9/14, but the market resumed on the 17th, the U.S. stocks still had a panic sale, the S&amp;P 500 index opened at 1,092 points and closed almost at the low of 1,038 points, down 5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index was killed to 8,883 points, down 7%, and the stock market fell 14% in one week.

The 7-year cycle came to 2008, the financial tsunami, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks plunged.

\-In 2015, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks crash.

\-2022:?

I would predict that in 2022, there may be a significant pullback in US stocks.

63,Hedge with Size and Time First,"Carrying a portfolio specific hedge can be costly. I have a 40% hedge in currently but that‚Äôs primarily because I‚Äôm not in the aggressive growth phase of my portfolio anymore. I‚Äôm okay with the carrying cost to reduce portfolio variance. That being said, if I were still focused on growth, I typically would hedge when I was leveraged. Otherwise, I‚Äôd simple use position sizing and increasing duration to reduce risk. 

Hedging because we don‚Äôt like seeing red in our portfolio isn‚Äôt a great reason to initiate one. Many portfolios can survive swings simply by waiting (depending on the strategies deployed). 

That being said, sometimes hedges are absolutely warranted and essential. Having a clear plan on your hedge is essential to optimizing implementation. A few questions I ask myself:

-What am I hedging and why?
&gt;Most often, answer here used to be hedging my entire portfolio (sometimes individual positions) because of leverage or to reduce risk in an oversized position. 

-How long do I want the hedge and is it dynamic? 
&gt;I almost always carry some short deltas however I do not perpetually carry a 20%+ hedge. Cost to carry isn‚Äôt worth it. 
&gt;I like to plan whether or not I intend to build positions and thus will want to increase my hedge. Or do I want to enter with a larger hedge and accept the hedge posing directional risk temporarily. 

-What am I going to use to hedge? 
&gt;based on the first two questions I‚Äôll either hedge via an index or options in an individual position. I try to use the current market to my advantage (selling premium in higher IV and buying in lower). For example, my current hedge is in VXX and VIX long calls (300+ DTE) that I bought when they were both below $20. 

-Finally, what impact does the hedge have on my return and am I okay with it? 
&gt;Take a look at the cost of the hedge and see if it makes sense for your portfolio‚Äôs prospective return. If you‚Äôre pulling in 10% but hedge costs 6%, you may want to rethink the approach. 

All in all, I find using time and size to reduce risk to be most efficient in most cases.",options,1643175488

Say AAPL has some great quarters and the stock skyrockets to $190. Since the strike is now considerably ITM say you keep the position open, since the delta for that option is now around 0.80 would any growth from their on be at that 0.80 delta and as the stock continues to go up would the delta and hence the returns keep going up more than if the delta had remained at 0.50 for the life of the option?

For the example I‚Äôm going to use Boeing- BA

Say I want to be selling 10 of the 18th Mar 22 (52)  $150 Put options collecting $1,380 in total premium (1.38 per contract). I ran the contract through an OPC and I feel even more confident in this bet.

Current Boeing Position: 400 shares

+1 $200 call expiring on 18th Mar 22 (52)
+1 $220 call expiring on 18th Mar 22 (52)

I am confident in these current positions. I probably will not attempt this put writing strategy just yet, but I want to hear some input from experienced theta seekers on what would happen if I did write those puts. Entry credit and maximum return would be +1,380 credited to me with $148,620 maximum risk but I can buy to close at anytime I want and I watch the market consistently so that doesn‚Äôt worry me too much. Plus, I would have the capital to cover if I liquidate some assets. Assignment in this strategy is where i get slightly confused. 

If the put options I am selling are ITM at some point, then I can just buy to close and cut my losses, correct?

Is there anything you wish you knew when you began selling options? Do you see anything stated by myself in this post that made you cringe? If so, what was the thing I said that is concerning to hear someone say when speaking about writing options?

23,God I love this market [Trade Review],"So the market opens up down a super casual 60 points overnight. Man, what a way to start Monday right? Just like Thursday and Friday, I start thinking 'man we gotta be oversold by now, where's that relief bounce?!'. But I know it won't happen in the first 30 mins with all the zoo of profit taking and shorts and noise. So I have to force myself to literally sit on my hands and listen to some lo-fi and just keep breathing to relax my mind/body to help myself make calm and clear decisions when it's time to strike. Btw, this doesn't happen every time, today just happened to be a good day. That's just how it goes. 


Morning Period

Anyways, [here's /ES after about an hour](https://imgur.com/JKldHoN). Those blue lines are anchored vwaps from the open and from the low of the day. The red dotted line is just a 65 period moving average, just a medium term average. It doesn't matter what you use, only the slope matters, whether it's trending up, down or sideways. We see some initial selling with some [pretty low tick levels](https://imgur.com/JuE5qZr) in the first 45 mins. You see those levels hanging around -1000 area. And that's important, it's not only that it flashes there but you want to see sustained levels in that area. After the lowest tick level of the day -1456 at 10:10, we see the TICKS back off and start heading to baseline. We see a low on the chart and the selling pressure hold back around 10:20. Some demand comes in here and buyers quickly take us to 4300 where anchored vwap from the open is. We battle with this for a bit and [probe up](https://imgur.com/IcKIHFk). See, a couple years ago, I probably would've just been so eager and bought here. But now that I use market internals, it lets me see what's happening underneath the hood of this move. And as this probe was happening, the [TICK was still only hitting a high of +500](https://imgur.com/JuE5qZr). That's still considered noise. You want to see sustained 800-1200 readings for a while to reveal some broad buying pressure. I wasn't seeing that so I didn't buy yet, I figure they fade this first attempt. Sometimes I'm wrong, today I was right. The breakout [quickly deflates and we fall below](https://imgur.com/9cUhIE2) the anchored vwap from the low. So this tells me everyone is underwater from today and sellers are in control again. Not looking to participate here. A bit later, we see it [fade and start getting tight near the recent low](https://imgur.com/wtYMtyO), not a good sign. We [sit here for a while and just stay tight near the low](https://imgur.com/FBDZ4xI) and then as I was watching the TICK, I see a [quick flash down to -1000 at 11:35am](https://imgur.com/IF4U2WU). We then [promptly crack](https://imgur.com/JQ4kQke). We find a new low at 4234 and actually see some decent down volume that could be signs of some capitulation. [Maybe the sellers are getting exhausted finally.](https://imgur.com/HO7G7Es) [Here were the TICK readings up to noon there, still nothing to be excited about.](https://imgur.com/hcpQzKB). We bounce a little but with still low TICK readings, I'm not convinced. 



Afternoon Period

We then once again head lower to a support that I felt was the final frontier, the 4225-4215 area. There is a big volume profile cliff there. I was readying myself and I honestly was getting a bit too eager as I'd waited all morning to enter this trade. This could've definitely went lower, I just happened to get lucky and it finally carved a low. [I bought one SPY 1/28 432 call for 4.02 @ 12:24pm.](https://imgur.com/rWBrV3H). This was 1 of 2 planned buys. Only half my buy so far, was planning on legging in. Now we start doing the same as before, start basing near the low. Except this time, the TICK levels weren't as negative and were steadily improving. We see some more impressive buying volume around the 12:42pm area. [I place my second order and fill at 4.58.](https://imgur.com/b0dulxH). We were above the anchored vwap from the low and the selling pressure seemed to have abated so I took a chance. My stop was today's low. And shortly after, we see our [first +1000 TICK level and we see this sustained for the next 10-15 minutes.](https://imgur.com/QaTsQIS). At this point we are also [breaking out above the anchored vwap from the open so that tells me buyers are fully in control](https://imgur.com/lEazQaY) of this session, this rally is underway. Now the game is patience and letting this ride out. We start really flying and then eventually we lose steam again and [come back down on top of both the anchored vwaps around 2:30pm. Crazy how accurate this indicator is.](https://imgur.com/ddAtlfX). [Here's the TICK during this fade](https://imgur.com/cQB9R0f), it was weak but it was backing off a bit. This is where I really starting sweating bullets. I had seen this market again and again have fake breakouts and keep selling off, I knew it could do it. But I was in this trade so my emotions were invested too. I said my stop was the low of the day so I kept to that and thankfully it dipped below the VWAP and came back up and never looked back. I didn't want to be in this overnight because how volatile this market is so I just took my money and ran. [I closed near the end of the day as the shorts were getting squeezed, you can see my entries there and exits.](https://imgur.com/wedUPKu). [I sold one call at 3:38pm for 10.00. I sold the 2nd at 3:59pm for 11.80.](https://imgur.com/08No838). Total profit - **$1,320**. Investment outlay - **$860**. ROI - **153%**.

25,Shares vs LEAPs vs Synthetic Future,"Being on Reg-T, anything but shares would cost too much buying power.

Now I'm on PM.  In addition to options being marginable, I can be short a put without murdering my buying power.

So now I'm faced with opening a long position via one or more of the following:

* 100 shares
* a deep ITM LEAP (my usual stock alternative in my non-margin accounts)
* a synthetic long (i.e sell a put and buy a call at the same strike and expiration).

What are the deciding factors when choosing the best option?   100 shares is great for buying power; ITM LEAPs give the exposure with less cash tied-up; and a synthetic long ties up little to no cash but isn't great for buying power.

Sometimes I'll avoid the LEAP if liquidity is low or the extrinsic is high.  Other than that, what's the best strategy for a given situation?",options,1643090977

29,Growth Stock (Tech) and Upcoming Earns Calls - Trade Strategy,"r/options

I got a trade idea I want to bounce off everyone.  

Maybe it's already too late, but within upcoming earnings calls on many tech-related growth stocks, I feel that we may experience a few more Netflix price crashes that could be opportunities within the options world.  There are still many stocks that are trading with P/E ratios between 40 - 80.  Netflix was exactly one of those tech-related growth stocks that crashed back down to earth with a trading price of $382 per share and a 35 P/E ratio after a brutal earnings call.

For example, $DOCU has experienced a massive selloff but even at $120 per share, it's still at a P/E of 65.  Brings me to 3 questions I have for the community:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Do you think this trading strategy is still viable?  Even though growth stock prices have decreased between 30 - 80% depending on the stock? 
2. What is a normal P/E ratio for growth stocks?  I know if we're considering ""value"" stocks, a healthy P/E is around 20-25, but that isn't considering future projections.  What values are we looking for?
3. What growth stocks are you still considering a bear play against during upcoming earnings calls?",options,1643088619

33,Let‚Äôs talk about Wednesday.," 1/26/22 14:00 is coming. I hear a lot of people saying a lot of things but I wanted to have some chats with team r/options and maybe we can all get some wrinkles together. I‚Äôll try to leave any commentary to a minimum and simply state some facts to use as a basis for discussion. This of course won‚Äôt be an exhaustive list so feel free to add in the comments.

IMO two things may end up happening on Wednesday: stocks will take off and the market will relief rally because rate hikes won‚Äôt be as bad as expected or things will crash because JPowell comes out as a massive hawk vowing to defeat inflation with an iron fist.

First, let‚Äôs talk objectives:

‚Äú**What are the goals of monetary policy?**  
 The Federal Reserve Act mandates that the Federal Reserve conduct monetary policy ""so as to promote effectively the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates.""[1](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/monetary-policy-what-are-its-goals-how-does-it-work.htm#fn1)

&amp;#x200B;

We can use this as our guide regarding what the fed‚Äôs objectives are before we discuss what their new policy may look like. Now, let‚Äôs figure out how they‚Äôve been doing with these objectives in the last year/several quarters.

[https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf)

On unemployment: According to the BLS, unemployment YOY is declining steadily. Of course, there‚Äôs no way to know how many of these people are gig workers responding to surveys as employed, but a drop from over 14% (last January) to 3.9% would lead me to believe we‚Äôre at least going in the right direction. It also appears that nonfarm payroll employment and employment in every sector is up and job growth has averaged 537,000 per month in 2021.

A few things stand out though:

‚ÄúThe number of persons not in the labor force who currently want a job was little changed at 5.7 million in December. This measure decreased by 1.6 million over the year but is 717,000 higher than in February 2020. 

Among those not in the labor force who wanted a job, the number of persons marginally attached to the labor force was essentially unchanged at 1.6 million in December. These individuals wanted and were available for work and had looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months but had not looked for work in the 4 weeks preceding the survey. The number of discouraged workers, a subset of the marginally attached who believed that no jobs were available for them, was also essentially unchanged over the month, at 463,00‚Äù

The unemployment rate affects inflation, and the more people that are employed the worse inflation gets. According to Reuters there is a current increase in unemployment claims but the expectation is that this is due to Omicron and will be temporary. There is some conversation in the following article though that there is a huge demand for workers and again, that will cause inflation to go up.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-weekly-jobless-claims-increase-amid-omicron-surge-2022-01-20/](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-weekly-jobless-claims-increase-amid-omicron-surge-2022-01-20/)

Unemployment is looking good, but what about stable prices? According to the BLS, inflation is 7% across every category and nearly 30% for energy YOY. The largest percentage changes right now are Gas, Vehicles, Energy, Utilities and Meats/poultry/fish/eggs in that order. The more consumers have to pay for the essentials like rent and gas (to commute to work), the less they‚Äôre spending on their NFLX subscriptions and AAPL phones. We want some inflation and the fed‚Äôs target is usually around 2% (give or take) but 7% is not good for obvious reasons.

[https://www.bls.gov/cpi/](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/)

And what about interest rates?

According to BlackRock, treasuries are being bought by a variety of parties including foreign investors, large institutions and ‚Äúmomentum players‚Äù. While yields are coming down since the beginning of this month, they‚Äôre still trending upwards since the last six months. Recently, the spread on the 2yr vs the 10yr is flattening out and the yield on the 30yr has been consistently below the 20yr.

Now where the heck do we go from here? And what can we expect the rest of the week? 

On the 30 min at the absolute low of the day at 420 we saw the RSI well oversold at 16 only to finish near

https://i.imgur.com/EMiqmGJ.jpeg

What does that mean? We MAY see another sell off come tomorrow. The 30 min RSI on the recovery has usually sold off once it hits &gt;60. We will need to watch that tomorrow. 

Now on the daily we have a little more clearer picture of where we are and where we are going. 
https://i.imgur.com/hKUCvZG.jpeg

We have a couple things to look at... we finished ABOVE the daily 200 ema which is now at 438.92. Overall that bullish.

We had a HUGE morning gap on the daily which has now been filled thanks to this recovery. 

We also have a massive green hammer candle on the daily bouncing off the bottom of the channel (light green dotted... on the daily it shows we broke channel but on 30 min we actually fell short... its a webull chart issue). Usually this signals a recovery is coming and the bottom is in. However look back at the hammer candle on 1/9. We saw lower after. 


Supports to watch- 438.92 (daily 200 ema- which we just dipped below in the after market) --&gt; 430.4 --&gt; 420.76 --&gt; 416.7

Resistance to watch- 440.4 --&gt; 447.8 --&gt; 451. 

417 is the bottom of the green dotted channel and 451 is the top. We are pretty much right in the middle right now. We could go either way.

IBM just posted their earnings and are positively being reacted to after hours right now. This could help push the markets green till more big tech releases this week.

Even if you don't have time or interest in reading the full lesson, at least skim the wiki page for the recommended further reading links. I found some really good stuff about improving your trading decision-making, like the [Forbes article about fast vs. slow thinking](https://www.forbes.com/sites/brettsteenbarger/2016/01/31/how-to-stop-making-idiot-trading-decisions/?sh=3aeaf0c572bb) and the [CFA deep dive on the Kelly Criterion](https://blogs.cfainstitute.org/investor/2018/06/14/the-kelly-criterion-you-dont-know-the-half-of-it/), to tease just two of the links in the full page.

Enjoy!

##TL;DR

------

* The only thing you control as an options trader is your own decisions

* Even though your access to information is limited and even though there are changes to information that no one could anticipate, you can still make the best decision you can with the information available to you. What other choice do you have? Depend entirely on luck?

* A good decision based on partial, though essential, information is better than no decision at all. For example, while it doesn't describe everything about premium and is thus only partial information, theta decay is a reliable trend that credit traders can exploit.

* Good decisions don't pay off in a single trade; good decision-making is a marathon, not a sprint

* Nearly every decision you can make about options is a trade-off, so a deep understanding about what each trade-off means is essential. Here are some of the most common trade-offs:

    * Risk vs. reward

    * Time vs. money

    * Strategy selection trade-offs

* The first step in making good decisions is avoiding bad decisions. Bad decisions can come from:

   * Irrational emotions

   * Hype and cognitive biases

   * Misconceptions and bad information

* The foundation for making good trading decisions is a rational, emotion-free model for making more money than you lose. I describe two, but there are many more you can research in general decision theory.

    * Expected value theory

    * Kelly Criterion

    * General decision theory and easy-to-understand explainers

* Measuring your skill at decision-making, so you can know if you are improving or not, is admittedly a tough thing to do. Getting smart people to review your decisions may be the best way, until you have a long enough track record to use your results as a measure.

##Mastering option trade-offs

------

An essential part of improving your decision-making for option trades is a complete understanding of all the trade-offs involved with options. Almost every decision will be a trade-off of something you will have to sacrifice in order to obtain something you want. To get you started, each of the subsections that follow is a summary of one of these trade-offs, but there is more to learn about each and more trade-offs that are not mentioned here that I will leave as an exercise for the reader.

###Risk vs. reward

This is the big one and the one that many beginning traders don't fully understand. Put simply, *the more reward you seek, the greater the risk you will have to take*. Maximum profit comes at maximum risk. I like to think of this as a Conservation of Risk law, although the converse is not true: If you take on more risk you may **not** be compensated with more reward. It only works in one direction, more reward implies more risk.

For example, if you opened a $1 wide call credit spread and collected a $.36 credit, it's understandable to want to maximize that return and keep the entire $.36 credit. However, to do that, you usually have to hold the spread through expiration and thus experience all of the additional risks of expiration, like [pin risk](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pinrisk.asp). Maximum profit at maximum risk. Furthermore, if the call spread is on a stock that announces an adjustment, like a split or a merger, your contracts may become non-standard and you may not be compensated with additional reward for the additional risks of holding non-standard contracts, such as loss of liquidity or accelerated expiration dates.

This implies that if you find a trade with lots of reward and no risk, someone made a mistake somewhere. Most of the time, it's you that made the mistake, by either underestimating the risks (for example, by not understanding how assignment works) or overestimating the rewards (for example, by using stale bid/ask quotes on the weekend that will never get filled in a real-life order). On very rare occasions, someone else made the mistake and you have an arbitrage situation that might be exploitable. Just keep in mind that you are in competition with big guns with lots of money and lots of resources, like technology and professional brain-power with bonus money on the line, for that fleeting arbitrage opportunity.

There is no ""best"" risk/reward trade-off. In some cases, taking a big risk to get a big reward makes sense. In other cases, taking lots of little risks to accumulate a lot of little rewards makes sense. That said, risk/reward may be *optimized* for a stated set of criteria, like minimizing [risk of ruin](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/risk-of-ruin.asp or maximizing the [Sharpe Ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp).

There are two related trade-offs to risk/reward:

1. Payout vs. probability of profit. The greater the payout, the lower the probability of getting that payout. That's a direct consequence of the Conservation of Risk law described above. So when you see one of those TikToks where someone promises that you can be a billionaire just like them, the probability that you will be able to do that also will be very low. You will have a higher chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime (a surprisingly low [1 in 15300](https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-odds)).

1. Hedging invariably reduces potential profit. This is another consequence of the Conservation of Risk law. Whatever hedging scheme you come up with has to reduce your profit in some way, because you are reducing risk, which necessarily must reduce reward.

###Time vs. Money

After risk/reward, I think the time vs. money trade-off is the next most important trade-off in options trading. Essentially, *the more time involved in a trade, the more money there is to be made or lost*. This trade-off has several aspects.

1. More time means a wider range for the [probability distribution](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/102014/lognormal-and-normal-distribution.asp) of future prices. This means that the more time you give to a stock, the wider the range of prices it can have at the end of that period of time. The wider the range of prices, the more uncertainty there is about whether the final price will be at a profitable level. This is where [time value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Option_time_value) comes from. Sellers of contracts risk the contract being exercised. The further out the expiration, the more uncertainty about whether or not the contract will be ITM and worth exercising. This added uncertainty means the seller needs more compensation for the additional risks they take on due to the greater amount of time, and thus contracts with expirations further in the future generally cost more than contracts with nearer expirations, all else equal.

1. More time may mean more [opportunity cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp). If you put $1000 into trade A and make 12%, while trade B over the same timeframe would have made 13%, the 1% difference is opportunity cost, because your $1000 was tied up in trade A and missed out on trade B. ""Trade B"" can be as simple as keeping cash as T-bills, which are considered risk-free yield. If you could make 4% real return on T-bills, any option trade that makes less than 4% over the same period of time is a losing trade, since you took more risk for a lower reward.

1. More time may mean more [cost of carry](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/costofcarry.asp). If you are paying margin interest or borrowing fees for a position, those costs are higher the longer you are in the trade.",options,1643048090

67,Automation Scalping System &amp; Live Trade,"This is a video showing an automation scalping system Ive been working on in ToS and testing over the past week. It is an extension of my last post here about spotting and scalping potential stock reversals using StandardDevChannel + MarketCipherB indicators. However this automation system makes the process much faster by automatically signally the stocks and what range they are in regards to StandardDev levels, instead of manually checking each stock. As you can imagine, this is extremely helpful for bringing potential trades to my attention.

Once again, I gain nothing from sharing this information beyond wanting to help out  other traders, no ads in my videos or paid promotions. So hopefully you  enjoy and add these indicators to your arsenal even if you arent a  scalper because they can be used for swinging as well. The levels dont  lie. Cheers.

**A few notes to consider in these kind of scenarios:**

* Overall portfolio risk assessment, how does this position fit with the rest of the portfolio (he mentions several CSPs are underwater currently - confirming our original portfolio plan is important)
* He outlines his trade allocation but no scaling strategy. I like to have my scaling plan in place before entering the trade (for example, after a XX% move up or XX% move down, re-assess and review scaling opportunity).
* With our trade underwater, we MUST review the position. Since this is an individual stock, that we may be looking to allow assignment on, confirming our disposition towards the stock is essential. 
   * There are two main questions I'd look to answer: 
   * 1. Confirm or deny original trade hypothesis; 
   * 2. Outline remainder of trading plan based on updated information
* My main inputs (if this were my trade):
   * Short and mid-term TA looks bearish. I would not be adding any additional risk to the trade until some confirmation of support.
   * TDOC doesn't pay a dividend, I wouldn't be eager to take assignment and hold stock - I'd continue to trade the options as long as viable. 
   * Adding risk is an effective management tool, but has diminishing returns. It's important to NOT through good money after bad simply trying to execute a failed plan.

NFA, DYOR, etc.

I have 500 shares of TQQQ and this is how I'm planning to hedge out some of my downside risk for this upcoming week. It's a short term play as I expect a little more stability in the markets after the megacap earnings are released this week and after the FED meeting on Wednesday provides some clarity to investors (hopefully).

If I sell 5 covered calls on my underlying shares in a barbell scenario (1 at 62 strike, 3 at 67 strike, and 1 at 70 strike), I will be able to receive a little around $200 in premiums (based on Friday's closing for these strikes).

With that premium, I will buy a call for around $200 on SQQQ (the devil, I know) expiring this Friday. I HOPE that my SQQQ calls will go to zero, as that is the purpose of insurance. You hope it goes to zero, but in the event something bad happens, it pays off well.

https://i.imgur.com/fnrkHb3.jpeg

The RSI and MACD both on 30 minute looks primed for a pop and the daily RSI is 26... i also strongly believe with how negative and bearish everyone turned on friday a bull trap run to 453 would be the perfect trap.

i bought a 1/28 439C end of day and will be holding it till we test 443. despite what im holding i really do think we see a run. 4 red candles on spy is unheard of a 5th would be hard to believe. if we get a red day tomorrow though ill be looking for green Tuesday. 

If you look at the blue dottted lines on daily and 30 min there are clearly downward channels im watching. https://i.imgur.com/fnrkHb3.jpeg
This chart right here shows it the best and why i believe that 450-453 could happen. That would give us a 3rd touch/ rejection of that resistance line. 

Just remember guys... this will not go straight to whatever level it wants to stop at and it will not go straight back to 480 either. It has to bounce, rest and reset the indicators. Plus the market makers will be looking for an opportunity to burnt put holders. A lot of people... even the most bearish... have bought heavy into puts. What a better time but now to flip the script.

19,"Expected moves this week. VIX, BTC, TSLA, AAPL, HOOD and more.","### The Broader Markets

**Last Week ‚Äì** **SPY** was lower by nearly 6% last week. Options got caught flatfooted as they were only pricing about a 1.5% move. Implied volatility was up sharply to end the week.

**This Week ‚Äì SPY** options are pricing a nearly 3% move this week (about $13 in either direction).

**Implied Volatility** **/ VIX** ‚Äì The VIX ended Friday around 29. Up from 19 the prior week. The last time the VIX was above 30 was in early December following a short sell-off in the market that saw the SPY bounce near $450. Since the pandemic sell-off in early 2020, the VIX has spiked above the 30 level 5-6 times. Each time marked an end to that particular selloff/correction. However, on sustained selloffs (or crashes), implied volatility can go much higher. The early 2020 crash saw the VIX above 60 and it essentially stayed above 30 for 3 months. The actual crash only lasted 1 month, beginning in late February with a market bottom in late March.

In other words, during corrections in bullish trending markets, a quick spike in vol above 30 often marks a near-term bottom. But on extended sell-offs or crashes, vol goes much higher and stays elevated long after the market bottoms and realized (actual) vol collapses. This has an effect in a number of ways.

The first is that options have a harder time pricing near-term events. Earnings are a great example. If overall market volatility is at or below historical averages, the expected move for an event like earnings is almost entirely pricing that day‚Äôs potential move. But in a case where options are pricing potential market moves of over 3% for the week, options need to account for potential market moves in the days leading up to or after the event. A company reporting earnings may see 80% of its potential move reflected in its options premium with the VIX 16, but it may be closer to only 50% with the VIX above 30.

There‚Äôs also the potential for outsized moves to the downside on earnings while market sentiment is so poor. This is the ‚Äúshoot first, ask questions later‚Äù phenomenon. Netflix earnings last week are an example.

Another effect of elevated vol is that short gamma in the market can accentuate near term and intraday moves. In a downdraft like last week, put / call ratios elevate as traders reach for protection. Market makers need to sell stock against the puts they are selling. As the market goes lower and those strikes get closer to the money, those deltas increase and more stock needs to be sold. Additionally, *as implied vol increases*, the delta of farther out-of-the-money puts increases as well, with even more stock that needs to be sold.

However, it eventually has a reverse effect when a market bottoms. As vol decreases and delta-neutral market makers are suddenly over-hedged vs out-of-the-money puts, and with the stock that has been sold on the way down, have effectively turned the now in-the-money put strikes above into synthetic short call strikes with stock needing to be bought versus that gamma to the upside. (Market makers don‚Äôt think of puts and calls in a traditional sense. Because they are typically delta neutral, every strike above the stock is a synthetic call, and every strike below is a synthetic put, or more precisely, straddles they are either long or short.)

The VIX futures term structure is now in slight backwardation, with front month around 27.5 and May around 26.5. That is a rather flat term structure, meaning those looking to sell high IV aren‚Äôt giving up many points of vol by moving farther out in time.

**Expected Moves for This Week** (via Options AI)

* QQQ **4%** (about $14)
* IWM **4.5%** (about $9)

**Main takeaways:**  
\-From 1930 to 2022 we've had 25 bear markets  
\-Average duration was 297.9 days  
\-Average move was -35.3%

This graphs the beginning, end, duration, and move for each bear market in the date window.  The bars represent duration and are read via the left axis. The line is the % move and is read via the right axis.

Some additional data below. I break down bear markets by different timeframes - some interesting information emerges (average duration variance spikes in 1970 to 1989; Move Variance spike in 1930-1949; etc). Another piece I found intriguing is are the outlier Months for bear market starting and ending, November for bear markets starting and October/June for ending.

We're no where near a bear market yet - down around 9% off highs. However, For those that haven't experienced these markets before, it's important to develop a plan. Sitting on the sidelines in cash, ""waiting"" is a dangerous game. Market timing is very difficult and is relatively unreliable long-term. (Also, interesting figure I came across, around 50% of the largest up moves in the market occur during bear markets). 

In these conditions, I like to carry a portfolio hedge (via VIX/VXX long LEAP Calls), monitor sizing, and size down temporarily when some of my shorter-term indicators indicate significant downside potential. Markets crash down, not up (except for COVID, there goes that saying apparently). At this point, my goal for my account is reduction in variance and income (I mention this because different objectives will drastically alter approach).

63,Iron Fly strategy," I usually keep my trading simple but was chatting with a friend about something he does that he says is little to no risk, ok reward but a 20% success rate or so. They are extremely tight so they usually hit the top or bottom ends but when they dont, its free money or so he says. He has to search and find opportunities and pick and choose. I was looking at this and it has some merit I believe.

For example, looking and AMD 1/28 options:

Call sell/buy - 119/120

Put sell/buy - 119/118

The mid-price on all the premiums currently is about 1.08 credit meaning it covers any movement in the underlying and transaction costs at Fidelity IF you can get all the contracts. At worst, you BE +/- a little. If it holds, you collect premiums. I ran this on my margin calculator with 100 contracts as well and it has a very immaterial impact on my capital usage.

65,Update: SPY @ ~$437,"Less than a month later and SPY is trading around the $435 zone as I had hoped it would.

To clarify, I thought some of the biggest reasons for the drop was the discussion around interest rates, current inflation on items (gas, groceries, etc) for these passed few months, and the spike in omicron cases. All this paired with how it seemed like it was topping around $470-477‚Ä¶.

Most of the thread got flooded with comments bashing me:
-not to do the trade
-opening a debate about the virus

0,"Gann Theory shows Bitcoin is worth remembering every December, Beware of Bitcoin falling to 28,000 as the interest rate hikes"," 

Many people proposed a target of US$100,000 at the time, Xiao Long pointed out whether Bitcoin would fall after a double-topped harmonious trading pattern, and we used technical analysis to analyse the recent Bitcoin crash. In Gann Theory and Cycle Analysis, we found the fixed cycle or Gann Turning Time of Bitcoin. In Gann's theory, time is the most important factor in trading. Gann's rule of timing is used to reveal the pattern of price reversals that occur.

&amp;#x200B;

 

https://preview.redd.it/p6gk505sc9d81.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=28e9bc5b9230fa83c0bcd5a53d324a08f4c535fe

As you can see above, December is a memorable time of year for Bitcoin, dating back to the first time it reached over $1,000. By the following December, it had quickly dropped 80% to below $200 and reached a bear market bottom. Two years later, in December 2017, the price of Bitcoin topped out again, ending the bull market rally and starting another bear market. This was followed by another bear market until December 2018, and December 2019.

As you can see above, December is a memorable time of year for Bitcoin. As you can see above, December is a memorable time for Bitcoin every year.

After December 2020, Bitcoin bounced back again for a short period of time, before rising to all-time highs. In December 2021, Bitcoin is now in a double top position, so beware that December 2021 could be the top for Bitcoin. Using the Harmony Trading method, if it falls below $36,000, the other big support level is at $28,000. That is, if it falls below $36,000, it will more than confirm the wave of Bitcoin's decline.

The trend in Bitcoin may be related to the Fed's tapering. In the last round of tapering, the Fed allowed some securities ($10 billion) to expire without renewal each quarter starting in October 2017, in $10 billion increments each quarter until the end of 2018. As you can see in the chart above, the last bitcoin peak was in December 2017 and then the bottom was around December 2018 and December 2019, which may be related to the Fed's tapering.

The peak in December 2021 coincides with the US Fed's hawkish comments and the possibility of interest rate hikes.

Xiao Long has said that inflation in the US has rarely been above 5% in the past, and that whenever inflation rises above 5%, the US Fed basically reacts very quickly and raises interest rates.

The first cycle of rate hikes was from 1983.3 to 1984.8, when the benchmark rate was raised from 8.5% to 11.5%.

Second: 1988.3-1989.5, with the base rate rising from 6.5% to 9.8125%.

Third round: 1994.2-1995.2, with the benchmark rate rising from 3.25% to 6%

Fourth round: 1999.6-2000.5, with the base rate increased from 4.75% to 6.5%.

Fifth round of rate hikes from 2004.6-2006.7, with the base rate rising from 1% to 5.25%.

Sixth round: 2015-2018, with the base rate rising from 0.25% to 2.5%.

Therefore, as Xiao Long said, most people think that the US ""has too much debt, so it dares not raise interest rates"". In the past, inflation in the US was rarely above 5%, and whenever inflation rose above 5%, basically the US Federal Reserve would react very quickly and raise interest rates. The author's greatest worry is that the US will raise interest rates from 5-6% to 20% in a short period of time, just like the stagflation in 1970.

As Xiao Long once said, the US stock market had a seven-year down cycle:

\-In 1966, the US went through a ""credit crunch"". In August of the same year, the US treasury market suffered a severe ""liquidity crisis"".

\-In 1973, seven years later, the world was hit by the ""first oil crisis"", which caused problems in the stock market and the economy, and the first stagflation.

\-Seven years later, in 1980, Wall Street forced the Hunt brothers to stop stockpiling silver, which allowed some banks and securities firms to avoid bankruptcy.

\-Black Monday in October 1987, when the Dow fell 22% in one day.

\-Seven years later, in 1994, the FED raised interest rates six times in a row, pushing rates from 3% to 6%, causing the most famous bond massacre in history.

\-Seven years later, in 2001, the Black Swan Incident of 9/11 triggered a global stock market crash and the US declared an emergency stock market closure from 9/11 to 9/14. The Dow Jones Industrial Index was killed at 8,883, down 7%, and the stock market fell by 14% in one week.

The seven-year cycle came in 2008, when the financial tsunami saw Hong Kong and US stocks plunge.

\-In 2015, the Hong Kong and US stock markets crashed.

7,Naked Short Jan '23 510 SPY put option advice,"
Hi all,

I need some advice on a position I entered into two weeks ago.

Firstly, let me explain the rationale that led me to this trade: 
- IV on SPY puts seemed high relative to historical levels (albeit not as high as it was on the close last Friday);
- I am long the market in the long run.
- seemed like good conditions for short put trade.

So I sold a single Jan '23 510 put about a week ago (premium of 60.00 an option). Obviously with the correction last week, my put has increased (to 77.02), which is causing me some stress.

Logically I feel that this is just a natural correction, and I have nothing to truly worry about, but I do think the market could have another down week next week. Apparently the breach of the 200 day moving average is a cause for 'concern' on a technical front.

So I am trying to think of a worst case scenario; if the underlying is put to me some time, then I will need to have 51k in my account to buy the shares ( 510 strike x 100 shares). I have 30k in liquid cash in my account, but my maintainance margin is only 16k. 

As you may know, in order for me to have entered into this short nakend put trade, IB requires one to open a margin account. So... (Correct me if I am wrong), I may need to borrow 21k on margin if shares are eventually put to me (unless I of course exit my put by buying it back at a newly higher price, which I don't think I want to do).

This would obviously be the worst case scenario if we enter into a bear market. I don't necessarily think that will happen, and I am in any case happy to hold onto spy for long term, but I just need an experienced investor to give me some guidance, and provide a sense check.

Thank you in advance.",options,1642857045

Hi all,
I'm new to the options world and I want to start trading.
For now I use a paper account, but practice and testing strategies takes a lot of time.
I am looking for a back testing tool to make my testing time shorter (and also practice at weekend when the market is close) and see if what I do is correct or not.
To be clarified - I DO NOT THINK OR EXPECT that just because I manage to have a specific result in backtedting, it'll be the same in real time.
I do think and expect to use the tool to make every possible mistake I can think of (just like in my paper account, and thank god it's not real money), and use the experience for a better use in real trading.
I saw on the internet that TD America has an amazing tool that let's to trade in different time frames. (https://tickertape.tdameritrade.com/tools/backtest-historical-data-thinkorswimondemand-15667)
Sadly, I'm a non american and I do not use ToS. Is there any alternative to such tool?
I know Options Alpha had a backtesting tool, but it's not like ToS.
I really want to shorter my testing from a month period, to days or even hours.
And if there's such not tool, is there any strategy/stock to use for shorter periods of time (for the sake of practicing with my paper account, I'm not looking for recommendations for 'quick money')

I want to sell spx calls considering the premium is far bigger. 

I keep seeing its cash settled. I understand spx has no underlying stock. 

But my question is in regards to selling lets say for example:

Sell 1 spx January 24th 4500 call for $ 3.40

I am credited $340.00 cool.

Now spx trades side ways I'd just keep the $340 like a regular call premium upon expiration. 

Now let's say spx goes above 4500 and its 4501 upon expiration. 

Do I owe the premium to buy back the call? For example:

$340- $1000 = - $760 meaning I'd owe $760 to the call buyer 

Or would I owe $450,100 to ""buy"" the index x 100 then sell it for $450,000  to the call buyer?

32,Can Long-Only Funds Hedge Themselves?,"Having a discussion with a friend who works at a long-only fund and he mentioned that they've been getting smoked on a specific stock lately but they aren't allowed to hedge that position in any way. 

Can long-only funds hedge existing portfolio positions by purchasing puts or would that violate their long-only mandate? I would think that as long as all their ""short"" positions are offset by existing long positions in the portfolio that it would be considered a hedge since they're still net-long?

34,Use covered call to pay for margin interest,"What are your thoughts on using monthly covered calls to pay for margin interest (as opposed to selling the underlying at a loss)?

I have a large SHOP position at a loss right now. (I used CSP to enter into the position. As a result, I have a negative margin balance now.)

I usually try to keep my margin balance zero, but since SHOP is down so much now, I don't want to close the position just so I can maintain a 0 margin balance. If I sell a monthly covered call against my position, the premium from the covered call can cover my monthly margin interest so that it buys me some time to wait for the stock to come back up. I plan to set the strike price of the CC to be the strike price of the CSP that I had used to enter into the position, so if the CC does get assigned, I'm fine with it.

What are you guys' thoughts on this approach?

This morning SPY changed the game just a little. We didnt see the normal pump to test the previous days resistance line. She decided to sell off, recover and essentially trade sideways between 442.5 and 447.5 till about noon when we finally got the trend resistance line rejection we were looking for for confirmation we were gonna dip. 
https://i.imgur.com/oLPFFNi.jpeg

That was your clue to get some puts and take call profits if you played the bounce. From there we just continued to see a downward trend making lower lows and lower highs. 
The big test came at 3 when we broke the morning low of 440.6... from there the sell off was on. 

There was a small battle at the daily 200 ema of 438.92. We did see some seesawing up and down. But the end of market we saw another big dip to finish BELOW the 200 ema. 

This is the first time in almost 1.5 years that we closed a candled below the 200 EMA. Something else to note this is NOT the same close we saw with a hammer candle or quick wic down and then back up. This was a full on close the candle below with the body.

https://i.imgur.com/mgr70NH.jpeg

Now looking at this last picture you can see if we take the bottom support from july 2021, and then the october 2021 lows we have a support line which comes into play right around 432.... this would put us at a total correction from the high of 480 of exactly 10%. To me this seems like a pretty solid place to look for a bounce.... 

However, im heavily watching the nasdaq which today dipped to 13730 and officially hit a 15% dip from its high... HOWEVER nasdaq broke a support in doing so and truthfully the next support I see for them is near 12700. Or about a 22% dip. 

If nasdaq continues their dip as we head into the FOMC meeting Wednesday and earnings end of the month (especially if netflix is any indication of what's to come) theres a very real possibility 430 wont be the bottom for SPY. the next support I'm seeing is around 360 (or a 25% correction). Something interesting about this support though is that it would 100% eliminate the 2020/2021 bull run and put spy back into a ""channel"" that it was trading bullishly in PRIOR to covid. Would be kinda interesting if it actually did this. 

What are my plays next week? 
I picked up as market was closing a 1/28 439C. For $6.7/ contract. My exit plan with this is monday to okay the inevitable recovery bounce. There should be a relief bounce to 443 and if that resistance breaks the heavy resistance is at 454. I will then sell my call and play puts once I see an official rejection at either 443 or 454. 
(Trying to be more detailed here so mods stop deleting my posts) üôÑ.

The other day I tried to buy a 0DTE SPY call contract in my live cash account. The premium for the contact was around 1.00 ($100). I had the cash available but it said I needed to have waaay more money available. Thousands! Which was weird to me. 

I finally got around to hopping on the support chat to ask about this and they informed me that it's an internal policy that applies for all 0DTE options where the expiration exposure would require your account to maintain funds for the full allocation.

I was confused by this because I'm not talking about writing options. I am looking at buying so the choice to exercise would be on me. Since this is not a part of my strategy I wouldn't be exercising.

Here's what they said:

""If it's a weekly option with expiry today the system will require the full capital should an execution happen. It's a system limitation implemented by IBKR. So if the call expiring today required 4k but the premium amounted to 400 your account would need the 4k in order to prevent a hypothetical scenario in which the option gets exercised and you do not possess the funds for the assignment""

""Unfortunately our policy is this close to expiration our credit system will need the full amount in case you did want to exercise. If you purchased at the start of the week this would not apply""

"" It is part of our risk policy however unfortunately I have no dates available for implementation. it applies for all options this close to expiry where the expiration exposure would require your account to maintain funds for the full allocation""

When I pushed for more information on when this policy was implemented they wouldn't provide me with an answer:

"" Unfortunately it's an internal policy, a business decision was taken to implement same of which unfortunately is not publicly available on our website""

1. beta weight your deltas, I like to use SPX or SPY

4. Use that to guide the sizing for your desired hedge

71,[Gann Theory]There be any cycle in the stock market? US market crash every 7 years?," 

Absolutely, the answer is yes, but we can't apply a simple and fixed model to all stock markets. Each stock market is an independent viberation with its own cycle and development laws. Therefore, the cycle and law of the stock market will be introduced before presenting the text of this book.

Since the 1900's, economists in western countries have engaged in the study the law of the cycle, and all believed that there was a long-term law in the economic growth or recession. There is noting new thing under the sun.

In 1930, the American economist S. Kuznets proposed a business cycle applying to housing construction, with an average length of 20 years. This long-term cycle is known as the ""Kuznets"" cycle, or building cycle. C Juglar, a French economist, published his Business Crisis and Cycle in France, Britain and the United States in 1862. In this book, he pointed out that the capitalist economy fluctuated every nine to ten years, as generally called ""Juglar cycle"". Joseph Schumpeter took this as the ""medium-term cycle"", or the ""Juglar cycle"".

Edward R. Deway, known as the father of cycle analysis, believed that the most statistically reliable cycles were 9.2 years and 3.83 years. He was also the founder of many institutions studying the cycles. Edward R. Dewey (1895-1978) dedicated his life to study the cycles (not limited to the business cycle) and in 1931, he was appointed as the Chief Economic Analyst by the U.S. Department of Commerce. Trying to find the cause of the Great Depression in 1929 and 1930 in the United States, Edward R. Dewey established the Foundation for the Study of Cycles in Pittsburgh in 1940. The following are some graphs about the cycles proposed by Edward.

Business cycles can be categorized into long-term, medium-term and short-term ones. You may ask, is there any business cycle in the stock market or the economy? Let's begin with the stock market cycle and then we will talk about the real estate cycle.

The 30-year cycle is one of the cores of Gann's cycle theory. When making a prediction, the 30-year cycle can be divided in further, including the following different cycles.

‚Ä¢ 30-year cycle

‚Ä¢ 22.5-year cycle - (360 X6/8)

‚Ä¢ 15-year cycle - (360X4/8)

‚Ä¢ 10-year cycle - (360X1/3)

‚Ä¢ 7.5-year cycle - (360X2/8)

üì∑

If this 30-year cycle is applied to calculate the stock market cycle, you will get an amazing discovery . For example, Hong Kong's stock market crash in 1987 followed with another one 7.5 years later, namely in 1994, because of the upsurge of red chip speculation by foreign investors in 1993 and the United States' increase of the interest rates for 7 successive times. 15 years later, around the year of 2002 and 2003, the stock market underwent a huge decline because of the outbreak of avian influenza. In 2009, namely 22.5 years after that, HSI hit the bottom as a consequence of the financial tsunami. When it came to 2017, exactly 30 years later, HSI witnessed a depreciation in 2018 after experiencing the bull market.

When the 30-year cycle is applied to Shanghai securities composite index, there will also come something incredible. As shown in the chart below, the first peak after the establishment of Shanghai Stock Exchange occurred in May 1992. Following Gann's 30-year cycle, another peak appeared in the half of 1999, exactly 7.5 years later. 15 years later, the year of 2007 witnessed the climax of the bull market. After 22.5 years, the year of 2014 marked the starting point of the bull market in 2015. It is thought that the year of 2022, 30 years later, will be another high or low point.

Just as the old chinese sayings go that ""both people and things undergo great changes in a decade"", ""gold may become worthless in a decade"" and ""we cannot predict what will happen in a decade and don't laugh at poor people wearing rags"". These sayings point out the essence of the 10-year cycle. Juglar proposed that there was a 9 to 10 years' cyclical fluctuation for the market economy in his book Business Crisis and Cycle in France, Britain and the United States in 1862. In Business Prophecies of the Future Ups and Downs in Prices, Samuel T Benner stated that the highest point of trade price followed a repeated 8-9-10-year pattern. The 10-year cycle also plays an important role in Gann Theory.

Shanghai Securities Composite Index with a Cycle of 120 Months

Take Shanghai securities composite index as an example. After reaching a low point of 998 in 2005, the high point of the bull market appeared in 2015, 120 months (ten years) later. After the low point of 1,664 in October 2008, another lowest point came in 2018, 121 months later.

üì∑

Shanghai Securities Composite Index with a Cycle of 52 Weeks

The above chart shows that the Shanghai securities composite index also subjects itself to a 52-week cycle. In the weekly column chart of the Shanghai securities composite index, the time interval between the peak in October 2007 and the low point is 52 weeks. After that, there will be return in every 52 weeks, either the peak or the bottoming out of the market index.

Let's see the weekly column chart of the Shanghai securities composite index and take ""7"" weeks as a cycle. It is found that from the high point of 2015, there is a relative turn in a cycle of 7 weeks or its multiples, namely 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63 and 70.

Is this a coincidence or an accident for the above change in the stock market?

Now, one question. Whether the movement in the stock market is driven by events or the high and low points at the previous time point (cycle)? Therefore, China's stock market proceeds in a cyclical way. The turning point can be predicted as long as the right starting point can be realized.

There is also a cycle for real estate. Although economists all over the world hold different opinions towards the research of the real estate market, but they serve the same effect. I will state the opinions of the following economists for your reference.

¬∑Michael Hoyt, the author of One Hundred Years of Land Values in Chicago, studied the price of real estate in Chicago in a time period of 103 years since there were only dozens of wooden houses, and he found that its price cycles about every 18 years.

¬∑Edward R. Deway, known as the father of cycle analysis, believed that each real estate cycle lasts for about 18 years.

¬∑Fred Harrison, a British economist studying the real estate market in the Britain and United States in the past 200-plus years, found that the housing price cycled about every 18 years.

¬∑Simon Smith Kuznets believed that the building cycle is 15 to 20 years.

It is coincidentally acknowledged that the real estate market cycles every 18 to 20 years. Starting from 1965, it is generally believed that the real estate market in Hong Kong has gone through three major cycles, the first cycle from 1965 to 1981; the second one from 1981 to 1997; and the third one from 1997 to now. The housing price often goes up or down along with the change of both internal and external elements.

I have mentioned the Hong Kong real estate market cycle in different situations. It is not difficult to draw a conclusion from the cycle of Hong Kong's real estate market that the cycle works every six years. Since 1997, great changes occur every six years, including 2003, 2009, 2015, and 2021. With Gann's 50% segmentation method, we can get that three years constitute a secondary cycle, namely in 2000, 2006, 2012, and 2018.

The change of the real estate market can also be concluded with the 18-year cycle, which has worked since 1985. Undoubtedly, the real estate market in Hong Kong goes up after experiencing the lowest point in 2003. Predicably, that the year of 2021 is likely to witness the completion of an 18-year cycle. Stepping back again, the rise of the real estate market in 2003 can be explained with the 6-year cycle mentioned above since the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1985.

It is likely that the upsurge of Hong Kong's real estate market will end in 2021, and then we should turn to the turning point that may appear from 2023 to 2024.

The economic cycle of U.S. stocks has a very obvious 7-year cycle.

\-In 1966, the United States experienced a ""credit crunch"". In August of the same year, the U.S. Treasury market suffered a severe ""liquidity crisis.

\-In 1973, seven years later, the world suffered the ""first oil crisis"", with stock market and economic problems and the first stagflation.

\-Seven years later, in 1980, Wall Street forced the Hunt brothers to stop hoarding silver , which helped some banks and securities firms to avoid bankruptcy.

\-In October 1987, the Dow fell 22% in one day on ""Black Monday"".

\-Seven years later, in 1994, the FED raised interest rates six times in a row, and interest rates rose sharply from 3% to 6%, resulting in the most famous bond massacre in history.

\-Seven years later, in 2001, the Black Swan event of 9/11 triggered a severe setback in the global stock market, and the U.S. declared an emergency stock market closure from 9/11 to 9/14, but the market resumed on the 17th, the U.S. stocks still had a panic sale, the S&amp;P 500 index opened at 1,092 points and closed almost at the low of 1,038 points, down 5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index was killed to 8,883 points, down 7%, and the stock market fell 14% in one week.

The 7-year cycle came to 2008, the financial tsunami, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks plunged.

\-In 2015, Hong Kong stocks and U.S. stocks crash.

73,Buying options vs leveraged ETF,"I did some calculations for buying SPY LEAPS versus leveraged ETF (like SPXL) and just wanted to run it through this sub:

SPY Jan 2024 Call 445 - around $5300 with the premium you can buy 49 shares of SPXL ($118)

Now it is just looking at the expiration date and seeing what happens if SPY closes 10-50 lower or higher. I calculate the profit as the SPY price in January 2024 minus strike price of $445 times 100 minus the premium that I am buying so : Option Gain/Loss = 100 \* ($SPY\_JAN2021 - $445) - $5300

and the calculation is straightforward for SPXL as that would be SPXL Gain/Loss = 49 \* $SPXL\_JAN2024 - $5300

&amp;#x200B;

If we assume that SPY is going up around 20% over the next two years then we will break even but if it turns to be negative then lose 100% on option but not as bad as with SPXL. On the gain sid, if it closes over 20% in next two years then options would be much more profitable of course.

I bought a leap for NVDA well before the stock split, and now, after selling off 2/5 of my options on the way up, I have 3 left. They are NVDA Jun17'22 175.0 Call(s).
Needless to say, it has been gut-wrenching watch NVDA step lower and lower over the last month. I have lost 50% profits on these calls. Don't ask me why I didn't sell when NVDA hit 330. I just thought I had time, and each few days, NVDA stepped lower. Now that earnings are smashing the market (sorry NFLX) it feels like NVDA is suffering a similar fate.
The only silver lining is that they are still very profitable considering my base investment. My question is now, what do I do? Do I roll the options up? Do I hold onto them since they are less volatile than OTM calls? Do I just give up and sell it entirely?
Really appreciate everyone's insight.",options,1642728280

Does anyone know if Nancy Pelosi's (husband) is still holding her options positions placed in December?  

I'm interested in the $CRM calls she bought in December at a $210 strike.  Does anyone know the premium she paid for that?  I'd have to guess that it's currently trading far below the B/E.

It's flattening and inverting. This is signaling a recession. This was what was going on with the bond markets the other day, what this means is the FED/BigMoney is pulling out. That's why we're seeing a correction. Moving money into oil most likely or other actual assets. The natural yield curve has probably been inverted for a while, but the short end of the curve has been artificially suppressed by the Fed. We're just starting to see it now that they are tapering.  


Doesn't mean freak out just yet or anything, but definitely think about being a bit more guarded if you are bullish. I would watch all of the banks to see what happens with them, definitely the European banks aswell. If things get really bad, you could see a domino effect.

*Personally,* ***I am growing bearish*** *over all of this and just want to get it all over with. I will be looking at SPY/QQQ puts tomorrow. If we go up in the morning like we did today for that fake out, I will grab some at roughly the 0.20-0.30 cent range. Usually the calls/puts within a 5 dollar range work for this since that is the ATR SPY puts out. It's hard to tell today without knowing how tomorrow will be, but usually the ones worth that much at the top end up flying 500-1000% 0dte. I am going to try to wait till we have a +2 std dev move upward/downward before I grab them. Don't know if the morning fake out will get us that high, but also this play can be reversed if for some reason we start moving upwards. Set stop losses. Move them up right off the rip. Don't get greedy. Do this and* ***YOU WILL MAKE A PROFIT*** *even if you get stopped out. If you get stopped out. Wait, and rebuy another option.*   


**This is an extremely risky play and I do not recommend you jump into this if you are not familiar with how 0dte options work.**  


I am only going to throw a few hundred at this and see what happens. It's been working out great all week so far though. Be aware tomorrow is Option Expiration for LEAPS that were bought 1-2 years ago.

Left ALOT of gains selling early but ive seen one too many reversals to get too greedy. And i 100% did not expect it would dip to 445today üò±üò±.

As anticipated spy ran this morning all the way to 459 before it was rejected. We WERE in a downward channel and 459 was the mid point rejection point. 
https://i.imgur.com/71IgHnf.jpeg

Fully expected a dip but not like this. And it sort of changes the dynamic again. Spy is predictable until its not. Now we gotta Re-evaluate our plans...

Here where we are and some support and resistance levels to watch. 
https://i.imgur.com/j3oiLr2.jpeg

The daily looks bad... but we have pretty much reached over sold territory. However i dont think we have fully dipped yet. After hours looks bad and Netflix just missed big and is driving a lot of the market down after hours too. 

Im watching this widening wedge. And the 200 ema near 438 as bottom bottom. Current support is 445 ---&gt; 438. If we reach 438 thats a 9% dip from highs. 

Something else im watching is the nasdaq. Their support is around 14k and they finished down more than us around 14.15k today.
https://i.imgur.com/WOBg60Z.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/EYFWi74.jpeg
Now IF nasdaq can bounce at 14k and hold support here i think we may see a reversal. Its nearly impossible to time the bottom of a dip... but nasdaq are at a daily rsi of 29 and nearing a 15% total dip from highs and a major support... to me that seems like a good recovery point... 

Okay back to SPY. 

We too are very much so reaching oversold territory and in my opinion the bottom of this dip. Nearly 9% total puts us at 438 and 10% puts us near 432. Daily 200 ema near 438 too. To me this seems like a natural support bounce area with the daily rsi now at 31. 

So where do we go from here? Whats the play? This is one of the lesser easy ones to guess. We are kinda in the middle where calls and puts could play. I do anticipate we dip to 430s next week to finish the dip. But this could be a good place to do some 30 dte long calls for the recovery too... 

Intraday i expect we could see a morning bounce like the last two days. Hopefully see a bounce to test resistance tomorrow. ALL rsi from 1 min to 4 hours and even daily are wayyyyy over sold. So i expect a bounce to reset those rsi before we can go lower... 

Intraday resistance- 449.4 ---&gt; 450 ---&gt; 458 (heavy resistance as this is/ was the middle channel break). 

Intraday support- 445 (after hours is retesting this üò±l ---&gt; 438 ---&gt; ??? 432 maybe???

Note- as im writing this we just broke the close low üò±... over reaction to netflix earnings miss is my guess. 
https://i.imgur.com/hcubuc8.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/F7YtFuP.jpeg



How im playing tomorrow. I picked up a 1/21 451C a little too early so its down a lot. But i expect we get a morning bounce to at least 450 where i can sell for minimal loss. I plan to play calls in the AM and wait for a strong rejection somewhere before playing puts. 

IF we get down near 430s tomorrow im going to buy heavily into some calls about 30 dte. 

We havent reached bottom yet. But its close. I think this netflix miss could be the final nail in the coffin to complete the correction. 

Now if we fall below 430.... well we may be headed for a more significant 15-25% dip.

27,Diversify Your Toolkit,"With the Fed slowing down easing and diving right into tightening immediately following a series of policy decisions that are historically unprecedented, the market is tentative to say the least. For the newer traders, we're entering an interesting style of market that can be a bit tricky to navigate. Take advantage of the learning opportunity while protecting your capital. 

* When learning, **I found papertrading different strategies** that I often used to observe how they acted **was really helpful**. You can either papertrade via your platform, or just make an excel sheet to track (that's what I used, it allows for additional calculations in one spot).
* This is a **GREAT time to experiment with different management approaches**. Do you manage profit at a certain point? Try different points (instead of just 50% bc TT told you to, try 40%, try 60%). While you're doing that, track the VIX levels - you may find taking different $ max profit based on volatility levels may make sense depending on the strategy. 
   * If you're long options, rather than using % max profit you could consider % return on your risk or by integrating some TA to determine levels you'd like to exit.
* **Be sure to add some different strategies.** For example, something I found was deploying a portfolio hedge (particularly when I feel how I currently do about the markets) was extremely efficient. I like to use something simple like /VX futures, VIX or VXX long calls. The trick to these hedges is you need to enter when you don't need them, otherwise they simply become too expensive. 
   * For example, this year I entered a few different positions. I'm assessing increasing risk as we head into the middle of the year (this is just my assessment based on what I know now), so I entered into laddered long calls in VIX and VXX. I'll use ATM calls for more immediate coverage, but these cost more. So I also add further OTM calls to add additional coverage that have a higher ""deductible"" (the need more movement until their protection really kicks in) but are cheaper. I like to use LEAPS to take advantage of pricing (since I tend to enter before they're expensive) and for a simpler hedge to manage.
* **Beta Weight Your Deltas**. This gives you a quantitative metric to base portfolio management decisions on. You can use this figure to identify positions that are over or under sized, model a portfolio hedge, or identify gaps in your positions.

38,SPY- Another day another bullish channel broken,"Well if you followed my post yesterday youd have played puts once we broke 455 and made some $$$$ today. 

Overall today was a heck of a bearish indicator. Nasdaq and spy couldn't be telling us any more clearly that we will be seeing a correction of 10%- 15% roughly. 

Spy broke another support today at 455.5 and not only that but it closes below the 100 ema all the way down near 451.8. 
https://imgur.com/a/O3fWIPd
https://i.imgur.com/6K8TnxD.jpeg

On top of that nasdaq officially entered 10%+ correction territory. Nasdaq broke a major support today and will in my opinion see a dip to 14000. Which would give it roughly a 14% correction. 

With spy confirming the close below the 100 ema we should see a dip to the 200 ema near 438. A dip here gives is about a 9% total correction. 

I believe once we reach these levels we will be able to see a full recovery and return of the bull run. For those of you who think stonks only go up... maybe go find a hobby for a little bit lol. 

Heres what i will be watching going into end of week. 

Today and right now Biden is speaking on covid. Hes inferring no more lockdowns or school closings and of course pushing his build back better agenda. Markets could see this as a positive and react that way tomorrow. I dont think we see a full on recovery just from that though. 

https://i.imgur.com/kXtNyoG.jpeg
Intraday we are in a downward channel and saw a bounce off support near 451.4 at close. I suspect we see a recovery bounce towards resistance at 457. 

Resistance levels to watch intraday- 453 --&gt; 455 --&gt; 457. If we can break 457 we could see a bigger recovery run towards 469. 

Longer term resistance of 469 is the major resistance that needs to be broken in order to confirm the bear trends broken. Another note on the daily is that the 5 ema has formed a downward resistance line also at 460 that needs to be broken. 

Support levels intraday is that 451.4... if we break this truthfully there really isnt much support till 440. 

Today for me was a nice day for me. $2400 gain day for me (not pictured is a call and 2 puts i closed).

How im playing the rest of the week. 

Tomorrow im expecting a bounce to 457 resistance and that we will get rejected. Imma go in on some 456P 7-14 DTE once we get rejected at 457. IF we break 457 ill ride a small call position up. Im not sure where we would get rejected. Likely stop at the daily 50 ema 464. However, overall a close below the 100 ema on the daily should indicate a dip to the 200 ema near 438.

I use tastyworks and I learned from their free classes, so I sold a 1 SD strangle at 55 and 72.5 because IV was high. Held for about a week and don't see IV coming down, instead it kept going up. Set closing position at 50% max profit like tasty taught.

This morning after the 25% increase my short call is now ITM, negative $850 loss if i were to close the strangle, and in negative BP. I have 31 days to expiration.

Support for the 1.5 year bullish channel (blue dotted parr
allel lines) was broke within 11 minutes of open. Thats when i jumped into some weekly and monthly puts. 
https://i.imgur.com/j3J6bep.jpeg

I have been calling out a new still bullish but definitely less aggressive channel for about 3 weeks now that i have been watching (white dotted parallel lines). The only thing that stood between the white dotted channels support near 455.7 and the blue dotted channel that was just broken was the daily 100 ema which was at 456.8. It really didnt take long and we were dipping and bouncing off the white dotted channel around 1pm. 
https://imgur.com/a/3pDoG4N

We saw a pretty nice relief bounce and an attempt to reverse end of day. However we ended up finishing with yet another white dotted line bounce for a double bottom off of the support line near 455.4. 
https://i.imgur.com/7uqUDwV.jpeg
https://i.imgur.com/IIe1k9e.jpeg

Things to note today. We broke the 1.5 year bullish channel, nasdaq also broke 2 major supports, we finished below the 100 ema on the daily and we did get a potential new channel support bounce. 

What im watching going into tomorrow and later this week...

Intraday support is 455.5 (white dotted line) if we break this i have 100% confidence we see minimum of 439 (200 ema). A dip from high to the 200 ema would net roughly a total 9% correction. 

Intraday resistance- 456.76 (daily 200 ema... note intraday spy did not seem to care about this at all) ---&gt; 461.6 ---&gt; 470 (needs to break this to break the overall downward trend). 

After market we have seen a pop to 457 already. 

Positions- end of day i jumped in as an absolute yolo 0 DTE 458C. 

My guess since we are clearly oversold on most time frames but i believe still in a bearish market trend... that we will see a relief rally to 461.6 resistance tomorrow. 

I am not sure if we see a rejection or not there. I would be suprised not to see a rejection and retest of 455.3 (white dotted support). 

If we officially see 454 im going heavy into puts. 
If we break 462 i will play intraday calls. 

Definitely right now dont recommend holding anything over night besides beyond risky plays.",options,1642544953

91,The Near Future Of SPY/QQQ (+Lunar Post #3),"Hey fellas! It is your friendly neighborhood lunar trader here. And first things first, I am hoping that you all have had a great New Year's and that your trades, gains, and plays are panning out the best they can in this time of uncertainty and crazy fed decisions and world events. 

I've been a bit preoccupied lately, so I haven't had the time to post an update on my lunar trades, so I'll include it in this post, even though this post is going to be on a different topic for the most part. So were we successful this time around? That answer is rather large: Nope. During the Waxing Gibbous, and looking at previous Waxing Gibbouses, SPY generally trends up, and it did, between the 1st and 5th we had a change of ~+$4, but between the 5th-10th we had a huge ~-$20 hit, and 10th-12th a rebound of ~+$14. And as you can probably gather from the 12th to the present, SPY has finished at $457, down from $476 at the start of the Waxing Phase (1st-17th). So what does this say about the strategy? Well, it seems like it was a complete reversal in its entirety. With that being said, This marks 0-2 on the record sheet for personal successful plays using the lunar trading strategy, more research will be done on this.

Now that is out of the way, let's discuss what we think the future of SPY/QQQ is from now, without using lunar analysis. Personally (disregarding the moon, of course), I remain very bullish. And as a matter of fact, I bought up 100 shares of TQQQ today as it hit -5% @68.22 a share. Currently the RSI (relative strength index) hit 32 at the end of today, for SPY  and from what we know of this technical is that more often than not, we see SPY bounce around 30 RSI. Conversely, we saw that the string of red days up until today was preceded by an RSI of +65, where 70 is the usual high end before a correction. If I had to share my opinion though besides sharing this technical, it would be that these red days are merely profit taking, and this is temporary. Some friends of mine say ""Here comes the bear market"", but let's be honest, that is not happening for at least a good while. Market Makers are taking advantage of retail traders in that they believe we don't know that the fed decisions, world news, etc is not already priced in, when it of course, is. What are all your thoughts on the current market, and where are we going from here? My thoughts in the TLDR.

TLDR: SPY/QQQ/TQQQ to see a string of green days following our 32 RSI. I'm buying this dip, and increasing the number of March 18th SPY $472 contracts. What are your plans?

Also wouldn‚Äôt a PMCC be really good hear considering a 29 DTE call with a delta of 0.23 going for $73 per contract which means if done 24 times without any price movements in the underlying to pass this strike would add up to $1750 in premium - $435 lost in extrinsic value = a $1315 profit on $1400 which seems well worth it.

32,Flawed logic with selling covered calls? Am I missing something?,"Hello fellow kids and adults üëã 

I was sitting thinking if strategies for returns and was wondering what‚Äôs flawed with this logic;

If Stock A is $40, and I buy 10,000 shares for $40,000, then that trade gives ne enough shares to sell 100 options contracts, for whatever I see fit. This is selling a covered call.

For the sake of this example, lets put all of our eggs into one basket.

If the shares I bought for $40k immediately are optionable, and lets say I sell my max of 100 covered calls for $50 strike price, for say a premium of $5.00 each ($500 per contract). That gives me $50k premium, done deal, and if the price goes to say $55 and the buyer of the options exercises, I still win on the exercise because I‚Äôm being forced to sell at a price higher than I purchased the shares for (I profit from $40-50, but miss out on $50-55)

So in reality a play like this would net the $50k in premium, plus another $50k when I‚Äôm forced to sell my shares at the 50 strike. 

in this scenario, the money double up is quick (considered a bit of a swing trade I suppose). Am I missing something? If something seems too good to be true‚Ä¶?",options,1642470513

So what's the catch if a calendar spread on a stock is cheaper with a higher return rate does that mean market makers don't expect it to stay at that price for the week therefore it's cheaper meanwhile a calendar spread that's more expensive with a lower return rate is expected to trade sideways for the week therefore return rate isn't as great.

47,ESSC - Fully Expanded Gamma Squeeze Signal," 

# Credit: u/stonkgodcapital

# Overview

## The Setup

This play is classified as a **low-float gamma squeeze**. This means that the stock has an *unusually small* amount of free trading shares and further it has *less than* the usually required amount of shares to have options. In this case of ESSC, the stock has 1.1M shares trading and the ITM OI accounts for 332% of those shares. There is also evidence that the float is actively shrinking to 340K shares (again) making this play not only even *more unique*, but potentially even more **explosive**.

This signal will lay out the specifics of the setup, including how we arrived at our calculation of the float and our analysis of the OI and the plays potential.

### What is a Gamma Squeeze?

A gamma squeeze is a type of squeeze caused by delta hedging from options market makers. When a high amount of in-the-money (ITM) call options are sold on a stock, options market makers will ‚Äúhedge‚Äù (acquire shares at market) to offset their risk. Normally this process is uneventful, however, should a stock acquire enough OI in comparison to it‚Äôs free-trading float, the act of hedging can create substantial buying pressure and a cascading affect that leads to a dramatic increase in the price of the underlying. Common examples of gamma squeezes are GME in January 2021, AMC in June 2021, SPRT in August 2021 and IRNT in September 2021:

# The Company

ESSC is a **pre-merger** SPAC. This means that they‚Äôve found a target for their merger and are in the process of completing it. Somewhat unusually they overshot the amount of time they had to fulfill their purpose and merge with a company, so in November, they requested an extension from their shareholders which was **approved** and their deadline was moved to mid-February 2022.

## Outstanding Public Shares

Before we work down to our float count, we need to establish how many *redeemable* (free trading) shares there are. To this we look to the SEC filings which state there are 13,800,000 shares that are freely publicly trading:  


[Excerpt from: https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001760683\/000121390021059515\/f10q0921\_eaststoneacq.htm](https://preview.redd.it/7jcvp3dutac81.png?width=2100&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=25c74c35ef232456d19a5f01ee835a93a7f59049)

## The Redemptions

During the extension meeting, shareholders of ESSC opted to exercise their right to redeem a *substantial* amount of the company‚Äôs shares. When shares are redeemed in a SPAC, shareholders essentially ‚Äúgive back‚Äù their shares and their value is returned to them from the company‚Äôs trust. The shares that are redeemed are **cancelled** and no longer exist. This means that the number of outstanding shares, and thus the float, is lessened by the amount of shares redeemed.

In the case of ESSC, shareholders redeemed 10,534,895 of it‚Äôs 13,800,000 outstanding shares leaving 3,265,105 shares outstanding:

## Backstop Investors

Now there is a final part of this that has required extensive research to refine exactly the setup of these agreements and what they mean. The end result is that these agreements provide the mechanism that makes the float extremely small.

### What are They

The Backstop Investors (BIs) are investors who are holding shares specifically to prevent them from being redeemed. Without the BIs the merger would potentially fail a vote or not have enough money in the trust account to meet requirements.

### How Many Shares Do they Own?

Per the agreement, BIs have 2,923,974 shares. Provided BIs are holding all of these shares, this makes the float effectively **341,131** shares. Per this agreement, they are **required** to hold a net-long positon for the **Business Combination Meeting** which should be announced any day now. The agreement establishes a mechanicsm that allows them to ‚Äútheoretically sell‚Äù and then acquire shares that were previously redeemed from the trust. This means that should the stock increase, they could sell their position and then simply reacquire all the shares they needed to be net-long at the price of only $10.26 per share. However, as we‚Äôll explain, this **isn‚Äôt the case** and as a result, any BI that sells is in **serious trouble**:



[ Excerpt from: https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/0001760683\/000121390021058879\/defr14a1121\_eaststone.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/s95tpxe9uac81.png?width=1266&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a0e61fffbc386b9262739d00de08cda1523efcbc)

### Can They Sell?

They cannot sell without consequences which remove their profit from having done so. Each of the BIs owns greater than 10% of the outstanding shares which makes them **insiders:**

&amp;#x200B;

[ Excerpt from: Insider Definition ](https://preview.redd.it/kbqkmbxauac81.png?width=1350&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8b58f842e37b1173bba868943a5d81b13fc28e7a)

Being an insider comes with certain restrictions, not the least of which is that you‚Äôre prevented from **swing trading**. This rule is referred to as the ‚Äúshort-swing profit rule‚Äù. The rule states that insiders **cannot** sell within six-months of having taken their position:

&amp;#x200B;

[ Excerpt from: Short-Swing Profit Rule Definition ](https://preview.redd.it/1geqd3rcuac81.png?width=1328&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=52ff8802249d362945e19840cc0c5c0312b4b7f9)

In addition to this, insiders are also forbidden from **short selling**:

&amp;#x200B;

[ Excerpt from: https:\/\/www.sec.gov\/Archives\/edgar\/data\/1164964\/000101968715004168\/globalfuture\_8k-ex9904.htm ](https://preview.redd.it/w48boivhuac81.png?width=1512&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=010b633f64a75059fb4c63fbd40e0e3eeb860d97)

&amp;#x200B;

There is also market mechanics reason that is disincentivizing them from selling. Per their agreements, should they sell, they were given a mechanism to repurchase shares from the trust to make themselves whole. However, this portion of the agreement is **nonsensical**. As was confirmed by the Trust themselves (credit to u/Spacul8r on Twitter) all the shares in the trust are **cancelled** meaning they **cannot be repurchased**:

&amp;#x200B;

![img](yl07nyxiuac81 "" Excerpt from: https://twitter.com/Spacul8r/status/1479163464778231810?s=20 3
Special thanks to @Spacul8r for their incredible help with this play. A true asset to the retail trading community without a doubt. "")

This of course means that should any of the BIs sell, not only are they forfeiting the profit from having done so, but they‚Äôll also be **forced to reacquire their shares at market before the Business Combination Meeting.**

So of course, the BIs have held their shares through all the volatility ESSC has sustained over the course of the past month, including the first run to $14 and the second run to $26. Well, all except one.

### The SeaOtter Sale

On November 16th, 2021, just ahead of the extension meeting, SeaOtter (one of the BIs) filed that they‚Äôd acquired **974,658** shares (a part of the total 2.9M that BIs hold together) \[[LINK](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001760683/000160825821000050/ESSC.txt)\]. This position was presumably held through the extension meeting and was then *partially sold* on December 13th, 2021 \[[LINK 2](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001760683/000160825821000052/ESSCA.txt)\]. They sold a total of **849,658** shares, which brought the float total to **1,190,789** shares.

As we‚Äôve covered, the other BIs have held their positions through the first run to $14 and the second run to $26 (confirmed as deadline to file has passed). For this reason we‚Äôre confident in our assessment that this sale was a **mistake** as it‚Äôs left SeaOtter in a very dicey predicament where they‚Äôre going to have to reacquire the **849,658** shares they sold **at the market**. It‚Äôs also the reason we‚Äôre confident that the other BIs **will not sell**, which locks in a float of **at most 1,190,789** shares.

### Possibly Re-Shrinking Float

As we‚Äôve detailed SeaOtter **has to reacquire their shares before the Business Combination Meeting.** Considering this, they are most likely to do this *before the meeting is announced* considering the announcement could cause volatility that would **greatly increase the price they have to pay for the shares**. With this in mind let‚Äôs look at something curious that occured late last week.

Now, we know on November 16th, 2021 Sea Otter acquired their shares. Noticeably, just before the meeting on November 24th, 2021, we saw an increase in shortable shares roughly equal to Sea Otter‚Äôs newly acquired position:

&amp;#x200B;

[ Excerpt from: IBorrowDesk ](https://preview.redd.it/n6qhtsikuac81.png?width=2318&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b8c0bf4268bde9c8a7ba8dcae43175d15eb136b)

Post meeting, this added liquidity was completely removed and only partially restored just after SeaOtters position was sold off in mid-December. Now, suddenly last week, the liquidity started to return with an influx of roughly 500K shares. Now, be warned, this is highly speculative and we have no way of knowing if this is correct until **after** OpEx because of the filing deadlines. However, we believe it‚Äôs possible that this influx of liquidity is due to SeaOtter reacquiring the position they mistakenly sold off **before the meeting**.

If this is the case, this means the float is actively shrinking **back to 341,131 shares.** Making this setup one of the absolutely craziest setups we‚Äôve **ever seen.**

### Final Notes on Float

We‚Äôve fully outlined our float numbers. For the sake of the play we are currently using the 1,190,789 share float for our calculations, however, we‚Äôll also provide the ‚Äúbest case‚Äù float calcs alongside due to the credible possibility that the float will be that size by OpEx.

# The Squeeze

Now that we‚Äôve got the setup defined as far as the float goes, let‚Äôs work out how that applies to the OI and creates our squeeze setup. As we reviewed, this squeeze is powered by market maker hedging heading into options expiration similar to GME, AMC, SPRT &amp; IRNT.

[ Excerpt from: East Stone Acquisition Corporation \(ESSC\) Options Chain - Yahoo Finance ](https://preview.redd.it/y697919muac81.png?width=1822&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cc3a3603a09628e3465a12f24b7d4f6a07986956)

There are currently 36,550 contracts in-the-money (ITM) which account for 3,655,000 shares. This puts the amount of the float claimed by ITM OI at a substantial **306%.** In the event SeaOtter reacquires their position, the amount of float becomes an astounding **1,071%**.

The next strike holds an additional 600,000 shares worth of OI bringing the percentage to **363%** (**1,268%** if bought back) and if the whole chain goes ITM the OI would then account for **517%** (**1,806%** if bought back).

## OI Compared to Last Run &amp; IRNT

Knowing that the float for the mid-December run to $26 was the same as it is now, we can compare the OI % of float which triggered that run. We‚Äôll also compare it to another known low-float gamma squeeze, IRNT.

When IRNT ran in September, the OI % of Float just before was **213%**. In December, the ITM OI % of Float for ESSC that triggered the $26 run the week of OpEx was **214%**. The number heading into OpEx this time around is **306%**, making the current setup both more loaded than IRNT and ESSC #1 heading into this week.

## Chart Comparison to Last Run

Below is a comparison of ESSC #1 on the top with ESSC #2 on the bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

There is a marked similarity between the two runs. Both runs started to gain momentum on the Monday two weeks out from OpEx. That run in both cases tapped upper resistance and pulled back for consolidation until Wednesday the week before OpEx at which time it returned to upper resistance, in the case of ESSC #1, breaking out the week of OpEx and running to $26.

What these charts illustrate is the process of delta hedging. There actually isn‚Äôt a significant amount of evidence to show that hedging is done in real time, in fact, there is far more evidence to support that meaningful hedging is done in batches on week 2 and 4 of a monthly options cycle.

## Short Interest

While we don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs meaningful for this specific play, there is a substantial amount of short interest currently in regards to % of float:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jaeasxqsuac81.png?width=930&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c903bf91556cc8252f48fe73def7066f9427baf

Shorts are currently just going out-of-the-money (OTM) on average, however, should price action continue shorts totaling **127%** (**443%** if bought back) could find themselves underwater and it‚Äôs very likely a portion of that can risk margin call.

## Comparison to ‚ÄúOther Gamma Candidates‚Äù

We‚Äôve seen an increase in the amount of ‚Äúgamma setups‚Äù since ESSC #1. To highlight how unusual and potentially crazy this setup is and how disengenuous some are being with their research, I‚Äôm going to do one more ITM OI % of Float comparison to two popular ‚Äúgamma squeeze‚Äù tickers on Reddit at the moment. By searching Reddit I found these two: NXTD and BBIG

&amp;#x200B;

### Calculating NXTD

First up is NXTD, I‚Äôm going to use the lowest listed float across these sites which is 4.5M.

&amp;#x200B;

And the options chain:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qkeu7b08vac81.png?width=1818&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6e1cb2a3a24dfb01e7f47b7019736c90ac2e9c6b

4,569 ITM contracts accounts for 456,900 shares which is **10% ITM OI % of Float.**

### Calculating BBIG

Doing the same here, we‚Äôll go with the lowest float calc which is 80M.

&amp;#x200B;

Now let‚Äôs look at the options chain:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/93on2t3yuac81.png?width=1840&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65eff291d2a61c1a2e8c5d4b21cb6686686021ae

79,457 contracts ITM accounts for 7,945,700 shares which is also **10% ITM OI % of Float**.

### Comparing vs ESSC

Now let‚Äôs put it all together:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/tm52l8tzuac81.png?width=725&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5090154682343891d01128637310ba4cfdaf6cc7

### Bonus: SI Comparison

Let‚Äôs quickly compare the short interest on the same tickers:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ll9w0so0vac81.png?width=932&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cff135db7208c2465da827a903e6e2af54f0034f

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/epbd24b1vac81.png?width=922&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aba5fe92b045391f7c62852b9530b61717d4a73e

Now, being completely fair, I‚Äôm going to recalc these using our *lowest float* numbers. This makes NXTD **17%** SI % of Float and BBIG **38%** SI % of Float.

Now let‚Äôs put these together:

## Wrapping Up

It‚Äôs safe to say that ESSC is miles ahead in potential and is potentially one of the craziest setups we‚Äôve seen in recent history. Everything about the play points towards an imminent gamma squeeze that is likely capable of **easily** beating out the $26 high of the last run. The OI is larger, the ramp is better formed and the sentiment I think this time around will undoubtedly be stronger.

# Closing Out &amp; Signal Overview

In closing, this expanded signal has been written to provide complete transparency for the play as often information can be sporadic and the full picture can get lost in translation across multiple platforms. Below you‚Äôll find our normal condensed signal.

## Official Signal Overview

**ESSC has met our criteria to generate a signal for an imminent gamma squeeze.** Our conditions require that a stock have the following:

1. Significant OI ITM
2. Organic bullish momentum pushing the underlying towards a breaking point
3. Increasing sentiment
4. Enough of an established ‚Äúramp‚Äù to propel the price movement upward without additional buying as OpEx draws closer.

**The Setup**

1. This is a **pre**\-deSPAC play. ESSC had redemptions triggered before actually merging, therefore there is **no danger of PIPE related dilution at this juncture**. We also believe there is **no further danger of dilution from Backstop Investors either**. *However, everyone should be mindful that anything is possible in this world, we‚Äôve done a considerable amount of research on this and are confident in our understanding of the situation, but certainly be careful and don‚Äôt over leverage yourself.*
2. The redemptions initially left the float at 340K, however, with a confirmed sale by one of the SPAC‚Äôs backstop investors, the **float rests at \~1,190,789 shares.**
3. We believe that at some time in the near future, the same backstop investors who sold, will be required to obtain their position back **at the market**, essentially repurchasing 70% of the float, once again making it 340K.
4. ITM OI is **302%** of the float. The 17.5c makes it **363%** of float and the entire chain accounts for **517%** of the float.
5. SI is now **127%** of free float.

**What we‚Äôre calling**

1. **This play is a gamma squeeze setup primarily.** Due to the high amount of options sold which are currently ITM in comparison to the float, we expect the normal market mechanics of options Market Makers hedging (acquiring shares to offset risk) to force the price upward as options expiration draws closer.
2. **There is a short squeeze component to this now as well** although we believe this typically are meaningless for this type of plays.

This play is very risky so only partake with money that you can afford to lose. ***We can be wrong, we have been wrong.***

**Good luck and godspeed gentlemen.**

55,Are NFT‚Äôs the new trending topic?,"Interest in NFT's has been rapidly growing over the past year. According to Google Trends data, the amount of worldwide searches for the topic ""NFT"" is slowly catching up to the topic of cryptocurrencies.

Many companies have started to look into NFTs and how they can monetize the rising interest from consumers. In this post, we've gathered quotes from recent company earnings calls on NFT's.

* $CTK: ""We are also looking into the potential disruption that NFT could bring to the entire content industry. So, we believe that NFT brings new opportunities for us to benefit our content ecosystem and expand the monetization. So, our internal metaverse working group is integrating a product, which tokenize digital books and the visualized virtual items of the books, such as the dresses, props, weapons, castles and so on and so forth. So readers who are fascinated by the book get a chance to collect and trade those in NFTs.So, these NFTs will be tradable within or outside of our app. So as long as the book gets more and more popular, the NFT holders enjoy the appreciation. One day a new game is produced on top of the story, the book's storyline, they can bring NFTs to the game to play and trade. So with the emergence of metaverse, we believe that we are well positioned to leverage our two dominated business to create synergy and expand our success.""
* $ACN: ""We are also working with clients to help explore and shape their early forays into the metaverse through new digital experiences enabled by virtual reality and responding to their interest in new products enabled by NFT, or non-fungible tokens, new ways to conduct commerce as the metaverse take shape. Many of these client examples reflect our goal to create 360-degree value.""
* $EA: ""As we think about digital collectibles, particularly in our sports games, again, it's different across different franchises. And so collectibility has different value over time. and collectability in games like FIFA and Madden and NHL is really built on driving value through the traditional sports season. I think your question is, is there an opportunity, particularly as we think about NFTs and other digital ecosystem to expand that value over time. I think the short answer to that is yes. I mean the slightly longer answer to that is we need to work and make sure we continue to appropriately tune and balance the experience for our players, and we're always looking to give our players more value in the experiences they enjoy, and you are seeing that based on the growing engagement in the game and a growing spending, they're getting that value. But we will continue as we have evolve the ultimate team experience over the last decade, we will continue to look for ways to add value for our players.""

64,Your Broker Matters!,"BLUF: RH is a garbage broker for traders and understanding their model is important for their current clients. 

‚ÄúRobinhood provided misleading information to customers about the true costs of choosing to trade with the firm,‚Äù said Stephanie Avakian, Director of the SEC‚Äôs Enforcement Division.¬† ‚ÄúBrokerage firms cannot mislead customers about order execution quality.‚Äù [https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321)

I was reading through the SEC Investigation on Robinhood more in depth ([https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/34-92115.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2021/34-92115.pdf)) and there's a lot of really important information in here for traders. Trader access to the markets is now easier than ever with brokers like RH enticing referrals via ""partial"" share referral commissions, gamification of trading, and the most liquid markets we've seen. Couple that with the difficulty of finding a positive real rate of return outside of the markets and the work from home boom - we end up with a perfect storm of unsuspecting clientele for brokers like RH. **Unfortunately, this is to the detriment of most traders.**

If we're investing (buy and hold long term), RH is probably fine. However, for traders, a place like RH is suicide for money. This is primarily due to how they process order flow and the impact that has on the trader. In the following finding by the SEC, RH engaged in slimy sales tactics that preyed on the ignorance of it's largely new trader cohort. They advertised ""free"" order flow, while participating in PFOF leading to worse fills than broker pricing. 

""According to the SEC‚Äôs order, between 2015 and late 2018, Robinhood made misleading statements and omissions in customer communications, including in FAQ pages on its website, about its largest revenue source when describing how it made money ‚Äì namely, payments from trading firms in exchange for Robinhood sending its customer orders to those firms for execution, also known as ‚Äúpayment for order flow.‚Äù¬† As the SEC‚Äôs order finds, one of Robinhood‚Äôs selling points to customers was that trading was ‚Äúcommission free,‚Äù but due in large part to its unusually high payment for order flow rates, Robinhood customers‚Äô orders were executed at prices that were inferior to other brokers‚Äô prices.

68,True source of volume data for an index fund ETF?,"I have been trading in SPY contracts and reading about various strategies. A big part of many strategies is volume analysis, which is used to validate large price moves and to help identify trends. 

The most common method I've seen for is to analyze the trading volume of SPY itself. 

This is the part I'm having trouble understanding.

SPY is an index fund ETF and not a publicly traded company. Its price is tied to the S&amp;P 500 index that it represents (+/- a tiny bit), and its price should not change significantly regardless of how many people buy or sell shares of the ETF each day.

So, for the purposes of forecasting the price movement of SPY based on volume analysis, why would someone want to look at the trading volume of the SPY ETF?

Wouldn't it be more relevant to look at the portfolio-weighted trading volume of the underlying symbols that make up the index? If the purpose of volume analysis is to validate price movement, that would seem like a better indicator. 

Alternately, I can see how the trading volume of SPY would be a good indicator of market sentiment on the index just on its own. Even if it's not a perfect representation of the volume data in the underlying index.

Holding 100 shares of UPRO and 100 shares of TMF and selling 30 delta weekly or monthly calls.

Would this be a good strategy be to sell covered calls in a $10,000 portfolio considering the recent split of UPRO and that premiums are high since these are triple leveraged and UPRO and TMF act as a stock/bond split though the fact that they are triple leveraged kind of ruins the point of splitting for risk/return but the covered calls allow. I think this strategy would be pretty good considering the high premiums and the fact that if assigned, just rebuy the shares using the premiums from both too make up for possible losses.

Note: UPRO can be replaced with TQQQ or TNA though UPRO is probably the best options considering diversification.

Also i know the point of the split between stocks and bonds is also to rebalance either by bands or a certain time or by whatever metric but for this strategy all premium would be held in cash or reinvested in shares with low delta options or just no options, or taken out as income.",options,1642358563

77,Breakthrough That Could Reverse Climate Change with Scaling Investments," 

This past September ClimeWorks launched the world‚Äôs largest ‚Äúcarbon sucking‚Äù plant known as Orca designed to reverse global warming. It utilizes geothermal power from the Hengell volcano in Iceland to propel giant fans that suck air out of the atmosphere and pass it through a filter. The filter is then released of the CO2 that is subsequently converted into a carbonate and buried permanently beneath the rock layer. It is estimated that this plant prototype is capable of removing CO2 from the atmosphere that is the equivalent of 870 cars.

We need to invest in ""carbon sucking"" direct air capture plants to reverse all of the damage from bitcoin mining, air travel, and driving.

83,The Ultimate Stock Option Scalping Strategy,"This is my personal method that I developed myself. I try to spot when a stock is in a potential range for a reversal. To do this I primarily use the Standard Deviation Channel and MarketCipherB indicators.  Once I confirm the change in momentum I will buy contracts, usually with 5-10% of my account along with a 10% StopLoss incase its a fakeout. Just this past Thursday and Friday I had 100% success rate scalping on 8 different trades, ranging from 33% to 11% gains on the options contracts which you can see in this video and my previous one on my channel. If I had continued to move my StopLosses up I could have easily made 2-3x those percentages. Also in my previous video on my channel I show you how to setup the StandardDevChannel indicator if you arent familiar.

I gain nothing from sharing this information beyond wanting to help out other traders, no ads in my videos or paid promotions. So hopefully you enjoy and add these indicators to your arsenal even if you arent a scalper because they can be used for swinging as well. The levels dont lie. Cheers.

I used to be invested in Square a while ago (&gt; 1 year ago). I think the lowest price I had seen was around $150/share. I had sold out of Square (sorry, Block) when it went &gt;$200 because I felt Tesla provided a better risk/reward.

I haven't followed the company in about 6-8 months or so. Now the price is &lt;135?! I couldn't find any company specific news. Is it just weakening Macro environment? Risk of interest rate hikes? Any thoughts on why this company is taking a hit like this (besides macro factors)?

89,"OOM NFLX option gained 6,500% in just 5 minutes"," 

After NFLX increased their prices in the USA/Canada yesterday, the stock saw a pump from 515$ -&gt; $535 (3.88%)

If we consider the Jan 14, 520 Call, it went from $0.24 to $16.00 (6,500%) from 3:00 - 3:05.

How does a &lt; 5% gain in a stock lead to a 6,500% gain on an option?

There are a couple of things I understood (I'm still new to this topic)

1. An OOM option went ITM, and that usually results in a lot of % gain
2. The option was 0DTE, so there would be higher fluctuations in the red or green
3. The IV was pretty normal

I can't confirm #3 (where can I see history volatility?), but NFLX traded pretty flat that entire day.

I would expect the option to definitely increase, but 6,500% in just 5 minutes?
